00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:24,190

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,785
PROFESSOR: So today I want to
start a new topic, circuits.

11
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:29,430

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,130
No, that's good.

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,390
That's good.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,662
Circuits are good.

15
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:34,590
AUDIENCE: Yay.

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,280
PROFESSOR: Thank
you, thank you.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,880
Much better.

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,290
So just to provide some
perspective, I want to remind

19
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,500
you where we are, how we got
here, and where we're going.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,170
So at the beginning of the
course, we promised that there

21
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,830
were several intellectual
themes that

22
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,400
we would talk about.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,850
Probably the most important
one there is

24
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,450
designing complex systems.

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,000
That's what we're
really about.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,920
We would like you to
be able to make

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,670
very complicated systems.

28
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,220
How do you think about parts?

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,040
How do you think about
connecting them?

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,730
How do you think about things
when you want to make

31
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,170
something that's very
complicated?

32
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,740
Part of that is modeling.

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,510
We just finished a module
on modeling.

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,550
So in order to make a complex
system, we'd like to be able

35
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,850
to predict how it will behave
before we completely build it.

36
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,220
Sometimes it's impossible
to build the

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,670
entire system before.

38
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,210

39
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,030
Sometimes it's impossible
to build prototypes.

40
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,190
Sometimes you're stuck with
going with the design at

41
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,270
launch, and figuring
out how it works.

42
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,340
In those cases in specific, it's
very important to be able

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,850
to model it, to have some
confidence that the thing's

44
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,500
going to work.

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,090
We're going to talk about
augmenting physical systems

46
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,990
with computation.

47
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,320
That's the module we're
about to begin.

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,060
And we'll conclude by talking
about how to build systems

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,900
that are robust to change.

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,240
So we started with the idea
of, how do you make

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,320
complicated systems?

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,840
And we introduced this notion
of primitives, combination,

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,350
abstraction, and pattern in
terms of software engineering.

54
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,600
We did that because that's the
simplest possible way of

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,350
getting started.

56
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,810
It provided a very good
illustration of PCAP at the

57
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,650
low level by thinking about
Python, by thinking about the

58
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,330
primitive structures that Python
gives you, how those

59
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,830
can be combined, how you can
abstract, how you can

60
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,450
recognize patterns.

61
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,120
But then we also built a higher
level abstraction,

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,130
which was the state
machine idea.

63
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,110
There the idea was you didn't
have to have state machines in

64
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,140
order to build the brain for a
robot, but it actually turns

65
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,430
out to be easy if you
do because there's

66
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,530
a modularity there.

67
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,550
You can figure out if each part
works independent of the

68
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,530
other parts.

69
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,510
And then you can be pretty sure
when you put it together

70
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,750
the whole thing's
going to work.

71
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,810
So that was kind of our
introduction to

72
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,570
this notion of PCAP.

73
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,820
Then we went on to think about
signals and systems.

74
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,730
And that was kind of our
introduction to modeling.

75
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,070
How do you make a model
of something

76
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,690
that predicts behavior?

77
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,890
So we transitioned from thinking
about, how do you

78
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,940
structure a design to how do
you think about behavior.

79
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,350
Today we're going to start
to think about circuits.

80
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,240
Circuits are really going to a
more primitive physical layer.

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,210
How do you think about actually
making a device?

82
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,460
So the device that we'll think
about is a thing to augment

83
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,350
the capabilities --

84
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,340
the sensor capabilities
of the robot.

85
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,490
We'll think about making a
light tracking system.

86
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,420
And the idea is going to be
that you'll build a head.

87
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,480
The head has a neck, so you'll
have to control the neck.

88
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,900
The head has eyes.

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,250
It will mount on top of the
robot, and that'll let you

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,960
drive the robot around
looking for light.

91
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,120
And you'll do that by
designing a circuit.

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
So that's kind of the game plan
for the next three weeks.

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,020
So today, what I want to do
is introduce the notion of

94
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,570
circuits, introduce
the theory for how

95
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,400
we think about circuits.

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,100
And then in the two labs this
week, the idea will be to

97
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,410
become familiar with the
practice of circuits.

98
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,750
How do you actually
build something?

99
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,780
How do you actually make
something work?

100
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,990
So today's the theory.

101
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,390
So the theory, the idea in
circuits is to think about a

102
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:34,070
physical system as the
interconnection of parts and

103
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,650
rules that connect them.

104
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,180
In fact, the rules fall
into two categories.

105
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,490
We're going to think about the
currents that go through parts

106
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,410
and the voltage that develops
across parts.

107
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,140
And we'll see that there's a
way of thinking about the

108
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,310
behavior of the entire circuit
that integrates all of those

109
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,160
three pieces.

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,670
How does the part work?

111
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,640
How do the currents that go
through the part work?

112
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,750
And how do the voltages
that are produced

113
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,710
across the part --

114
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,820
how do they work?

115
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,880
So I'll just start with two
very simple examples.

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,735
The first is the most trivial
example you can think about.

117
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:14,750
You can think about a flashlight
as a circuit.

118
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,700
You close the switch,
current flows.

119
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,450
Very simple idea.

120
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,100
We will make a model of that
that looks like this.

121
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,600
We'll think about the battery
being a source.

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,640
In this case, a voltage
source.

123
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,020
We'll think about the light
bulb being a resistor.

124
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
We'll have two parts.

125
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,480
We'll have to know the
current-voltage relationships

126
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,880
for both of the parts.

127
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,670
And we'll have to know the
ramifications for those

128
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,400
currents and voltages when
you put them together.

129
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,620
Very, very simple.

130
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,330
The other simple example that
I want to illustrate is this

131
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,790
idea of a leaky tank.

132
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,600
Here the idea that I want to get
across is that the circuit

133
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,810
idea is quite general.

134
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,770
When we talk about circuits,
we almost always talk about

135
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,220
electronic circuits.

136
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,400
But the theory is by no means
limited to electronics.

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,870
So for example, if we think
about a leaky tank, we think

138
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,840
about a pipe spewing water
into a reservoir.

139
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,730
Maybe that's the Cambridge
Reservoir.

140
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,680
Maybe that's the water coming
out of the Woburn Reservoir.

141
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,120
Maybe that's the demand put on
by the Cambridge people trying

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,310
to take showers in
the morning --

143
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,830
I don't know.

144
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,160
So we think about flow
into a tank, a

145
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,880
reservoir, and flow out.

146
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,790
And we can make a model for that
in terms of a circuit.

147
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,220
In the circuit there
are through

148
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,370
variables and across variables.

149
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,510
In an electronic circuit, the
through variable is current.

150
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,000
Here the through variable
is the flow rate.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,420
So it's the flow of water in
and the flow of water out,

152
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,990
represented here
by these things

153
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,840
that look like currents.

154
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,000
And the across variable for an
electronic device is voltage.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,870
The across variable for this
kind of a fluidic device, the

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,180
across variable is pressure.

157
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,520
So we think as this thing gets
ahead of that thing, as

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
there's more stuff coming in
than going out, the height

159
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,870
goes up and the pressure
builds.

160
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,690
Same idea.

161
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,070
So the point is that we'll
develop the theory for

162
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,260
circuits in terms
of electronics.

163
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,640
But you should keep in the back
of your mind that it's a

164
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,980
lot more general idea than
just electronics.

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,070
In fact, there are two
completely distinct reasons

166
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,660
why we even bother
with circuits.

167
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,120
One is that they're very
important to physical systems.

168
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,430
If you're designing a power
network, of course you have to

169
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,170
think about the way the power
network, the power grid works

170
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,130
as a circuit.

171
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,430
That's obvious.

172
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,950
In electronics, of course, if
you're going to build a cell

173
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,090
phone, you have to know how
the parts interconnect

174
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:40,710
electronically.

175
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,750
That's obvious.

176
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,540
But probably the biggest use for
circuits these days is not

177
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,800
those applications, although
those are very important.

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,720
Circuits are also used
as models of things.

179
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,360
So many models for complex
behaviors are in

180
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,820
fact circuit models.

181
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,760
So in terms of electronics, the
idea is that we want to

182
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,100
get on top of electronics.

183
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,240
We want to understand how
circuits work, so we can

184
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,170
understand things like that.

185
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:16,110
If you look at how complex
processors have got over my

186
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,970
professional life, we start with
my professional life down

187
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,090
at about 1,000 transistors
per processor.

188
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,990
And today, we're up at
about a billion.

189
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,420
That's enormous.

190
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,380
Even in the stone ages when we
were designing things that had

191
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,549
a thousand parts, we still had
trouble thinking about those

192
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,070
thousands parts all at once.

193
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,790
We still need PCAP.

194
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,040
We still needed ways of
combining the activities of

195
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,340
many things into a conceptual
unit that was bigger.

196
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,030
Here, it's just impossible
if you don't have that.

197
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,760
So that's one of the reasons
we study circuits.

198
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,390
And the other reason is here.

199
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,680
So here I'm showing a
model for the way

200
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,800
a nerve cell works.

201
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,860
This model is taken
from 6.021.

202
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,280
The idea, this comes from the
study of the Hodgkin-Huxley

203
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,810
model for neural conduction,
arguably the most successful

204
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,020
mathematical theory
in biophysics.

205
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,510
Which explains the completely
non-trivial relationship

206
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,260
between how the parts from
biology works and the behavior

207
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,460
in terms of propagated action
potentials works.

208
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,500
So the idea is that we
understand how this biological

209
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,740
system works because
we think about it

210
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,470
in terms of a circuit.

211
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,430
That's the only successful way
we have to think about that.

212
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,430
So what I want to do then is
spend today figuring out

213
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,650
circuits At the very most
primitive level.

214
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,330
The level that I'm going to
talk about in terms of

215
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,530
circuits is roughly analogous
to the level that we talked

216
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,020
about with Python when we were
thinking about how Python

217
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,590
provides utilities for
primitives, combinations,

218
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,260
abstractions, and patterns.

219
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,220
So I'm going to start at the
very lowest level and think

220
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,290
about, what are the basic
primitives, the smallest units

221
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,740
we'll ever think about
in terms of circuits?

222
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,450
And what are the rules by
which we combine them?

223
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,090
So I'll start with the very
simplest ideas, the very

224
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,020
simplest elements.

225
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,720
We will oversimplify things
and think about the very

226
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,010
simplest kind of electronic
elements as resistors that

227
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,640
obey Ohm's Law, V equals iR.

228
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,420

229
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,610
Voltage sources, things that
maintain a constant voltage

230
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,740
regardless of what you do.

231
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,290
And current sources, things
that maintain a constant

232
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,810
current regardless
of what you do.

233
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,640
These things are, as I said,
analogous to the primitive

234
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,890
things that we looked
at in Python.

235
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,750
They're also analogous to the
primitive things that we

236
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,470
looked at in system functions.

237
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,900
Can somebody think of, when
we were doing difference

238
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,880
equations, what were the
primitives that we

239
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,680
started with --

240
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,770
when we started to study
difference equations?

241
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,260
What's the most primitive
elements

242
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,510
that we thought about?

243
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,937

244
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:22,320
AUDIENCE: Delay.

245
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,340
PROFESSOR: Delay, yeah.

246
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,740
So we thought about
things like--

247
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,390

248
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,640
so we had delay.

249
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,810

250
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,600
Anything else?

251
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,330
AUDIENCE: Gain.

252
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,300
PROFESSOR: Gain.

253
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,550
Anything else?

254
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,463

255
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,960
Add.

256
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,130
So we had exactly three
primitives.

257
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,850
And we got pretty far with
those three primitives.

258
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,000
We learned the rules for
interconnection.

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,340
We didn't really make a
big deal out of it.

260
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,320
We didn't formalize it, but the
rules for interconnection

261
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,430
were something like
every node has to

262
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,810
have exactly one generator.

263
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,830
You can't connect the
output of this to

264
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,890
this, that's illegal.

265
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,220
Every node has to
have one source.

266
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,010
And every node can source
lots of inputs.

267
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,050
That was kind of the rules
of the interconnect.

268
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,505
The interconnects here will be a
little bit more complicated.

269
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:18,340

270
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,960
So those are the elements
that we'll think about.

271
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,370
And the first step's going to be
to think about, how do they

272
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,800
interconnect?

273
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,160
The simplest possible
interconnections are trivial.

274
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,580
In the case of the battery, you
hook up the voltage source

275
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,280
to the resistor.

276
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,100
The voltage source makes
the voltage across

277
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,220
this resistor 1 Volt.

278
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,910
If we say the resistor is 1
Ohm, then there's 1 Amp

279
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,745
current period.

280
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:41,510
Done.

281
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,750
Easy.

282
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,160
Similarly, if we were to hook
up the resistor to a current

283
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,120
source, we would get something
equally easy.

284
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,060
Except now the current source
would guarantee that the

285
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,450
current through the resistor
is an amp.

286
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,360
Therefore, the voltage across
the resistor, by Ohm's law,

287
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,700
would be a Volt.

288
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,830
So we would end up with the same
solution for a completely

289
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,940
different reason.

290
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,340
Here the voltage
is constrained.

291
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,590
Here the current's
constrained.

292
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,390

293
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:16,090
Just to make sure everybody's
with me, figure out, what's

294
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,450
the current i that goes
through this resistor?

295
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,040
Slightly more complicated
system.

296
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,120
Take 20 seconds, talk to your
neighbor, figure out a number

297
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,820
between (1) and (5).

298
00:13:25,820 --> 00:15:23,520

299
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,690
OK, so what's the answer?

300
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,630
Everybody raise your hand with
a number (1) through (5).

301
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,980
Come on, everybody vote.

302
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,920
Come on.

303
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,020
You can blame it on your
neighbor, that's the rules.

304
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,790
You talk to your neighbor,
then you can blame dumb

305
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,150
answers on your neighbor.

306
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,100
OK, about 80% correct I'd say.

307
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,410
So how do you think
about this?

308
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,450
What's going to be
the current?

309
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,420
How would you calculate
the current?

310
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,670
What do I do first?

311
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,462

312
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:48,930
Shout.

313
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,772
If you shout, and especially
if my head's turned away I

314
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:55,260
don't know who you are.

315
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,200
AUDIENCE: Kirchhoff's law.

316
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,240
PROFESSOR: Kirchoff's
law, wonderful.

317
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,717
Which one?

318
00:15:57,717 --> 00:16:00,102
There's two of them.

319
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:02,964
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

320
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:04,130
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

321
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,663
What loop do you want to use?

322
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:06,430
AUDIENCE: Left.

323
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,220
PROFESSOR: Left side.

324
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,960
So if we use the left side loop,
we would conclude that

325
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,310
there's a volt across
the resistor.

326
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,288
So the current would be?

327
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:16,764
AUDIENCE: 1 Amp.

328
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:17,748
PROFESSOR: An amp.

329
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:21,684
Where's the current come from?

330
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,160
AUDIENCE: The voltage.

331
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,080
PROFESSOR: The voltage source
just like before.

332
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,880
So not quite.

333
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,210
So the voltage source
establishes this

334
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,710
voltage would be 1.

335
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,850
That makes this current be 1.

336
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,220
That would be consistent with
the current coming out of

337
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,250
here, except we have to also
think about that 1 Amp source.

338
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,810

339
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,780
So the question is, what's
does the 1 Amp source do?

340
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,370
Nothing?

341
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,240
It's just there sort of
for decoration or for

342
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] so that we
can make an interesting

343
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,580
question to ask in lecture?

344
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,830
Maybe.

345
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,870

346
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,040
So where's the current?

347
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,689
Where's the 1 Amp that
goes through the

348
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,184
resistor come from?

349
00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:07,180
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
on the right.

350
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,176
PROFESSOR: It comes
from the right.

351
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:11,080
It comes from the current
over here.

352
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,130
So the idea is that if this
current, ignore the voltage

353
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,150
over here for the moment.

354
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,560
If this current flowed through
the resistor, then you'd have

355
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,130
1 Amp going through there, and
you'd have 1 Volt generated by

356
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,069
that current which just happens
to be exactly the

357
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,900
right voltage to match
the voltage

358
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,930
from the voltage source.

359
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,640
So if you think about this, the
voltage guarantees that

360
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,720
this is 1 Volt, but so
does the current.

361
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,980
In order to simultaneously
satisfy everything, all you

362
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,310
need to do is have all of this
current go around and come

363
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,240
down through that resistor.

364
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,070
That will generate the volt, so
there's no propensity for

365
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,020
more current to flow out of the
source because the source

366
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,580
is 1 Volt and it's facing a
circuit that's already 1 Volt.

367
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,310
So the idea was to try to give
you something that's

368
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,260
relatively simple that you can
think through on your own, but

369
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,530
not trivial.

370
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,060
So the answer was 1 Amp.

371
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,870
But the 1 Amp was not for
the trivial reason.

372
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,280
The 1 Amp is because the current
from the right flows

373
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,470
through the resistor and
makes the voltage be 1.

374
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,900
So the right answer is 1.

375
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,290
But for the reason that
you might not

376
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,490
have originally thought.

377
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,140
But more importantly, I wanted
to use that as a motivation

378
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,013
for thinking about, how do we
think about bigger circuits?

379
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:27,670

380
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,240
So when the simple circuit,
like two parts, it's no

381
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,260
problem figuring out what the
answer's going to be.

382
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,430
But when the circuit has even
three parts, it may require

383
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,290
more thinking.

384
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,480
And you may want to have a
more structured way of

385
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,630
thinking about the solution.

386
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,487
Yes?

387
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,409
AUDIENCE: What would have
occurred if the current

388
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:45,844
provider on the right
side was 2 Amps?

389
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,792
PROFESSOR: Great question.

390
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:51,660
Had this been 2 Amps, you can't
violate this voltage.

391
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,570
So that would have
been 1 Volt.

392
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,790
So that would have been 1 Amp
through the resistor.

393
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,560
So then you're left with the
problem with this guy's

394
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,330
pushing 2 and that guy's
only eating 1.

395
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,660
But the rules for the voltage
source say eat or source

396
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,140
however much current is
necessary in order to make the

397
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,900
voltage equal to 1.

398
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,070
So the excess amp goes through
the voltage source.

399
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,400
So the voltage source is, in
fact, being supplied power

400
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,350
rather than supplying
power itself.

401
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,400
Had this been 2 Amps, some of
the power from this source

402
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,060
would have gone into
the resistor.

403
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,730
And some of the power from
this source would have

404
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,030
actually gone into the
voltage source.

405
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,150
So if the voltage source were,
for example, a model for a

406
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,250
rechargeable battery,
that rechargeable

407
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,720
battery would be charging.

408
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,905
Does that make sense?

409
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,240
So if there had been a mismatch
in the conditions,

410
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,210
you still have to satisfy all
the relationships from all of

411
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,470
the sources.

412
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,770
AUDIENCE: What if the
voltage was larger?

413
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,609
PROFESSOR: The same thing
would have happened.

414
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,265
Except now the flowing
current would be in

415
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:01,990
the opposite direction.

416
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,620
Let's say that if the voltage
here had been 2 Volts, then

417
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,530
the voltage would have required
that there is 2 Amps

418
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,730
flowing here.

419
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,590
1 Amp would come from here,
but another Amp

420
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,130
would come from here.

421
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,020
This voltage source will supply
whatever current is

422
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,521
necessary to make its
voltage law real.

423
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:26,420

424
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,495
Ok.

425
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,570
In fact, what we'll do now is
turn toward a discussion of

426
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,960
more complicated systems that
will let you go back and in

427
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,430
retrospect, analyze all those
cases that we just did.

428
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,240
And you'll be able to see
trivially how that has to be

429
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,460
the right answer.

430
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:46,460
So what I want to do now is
generate a formal structure

431
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,960
for how you would
solve circuits.

432
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,352
Yes?

433
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:53,240
AUDIENCE: So did we know of
anything that could generate a

434
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,800
current without generating a
voltage, like in real life?

435
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,310
PROFESSOR: Can anything generate
a current without

436
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,080
generating a voltage?

437
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,130
That's a tricky question.

438
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,280
If you think about something as
generating a current, then

439
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,700
the voltage is not necessarily
determined by that part.

440
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,030
So that's kind of illustrated
here.

441
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,000
If this guy is generating a
current, this guy is not

442
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,755
actually the element that is
controlling its own voltage.

443
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:24,560

444
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,470
In general, if you want to speak
simultaneously about the

445
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,000
current and voltage across the
device, you have to know what

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,600
it was connected to.

447
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,020
Each part--

448
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,790
we'll get to this in a moment
in case some of you are

449
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,940
worried about launching ahead.

450
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,300
We will cover this.

451
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
This is very good motivation for
figuring out what's going

452
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,690
to happen in the next
three slides.

453
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:54,320
So each part gets to tell you
one relationship between

454
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,790
voltage and current.

455
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,450
Generally speaking, that's not
enough to solve for voltage

456
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,030
and current.

457
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,200
Voltage and current is
like two unknowns.

458
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,300

459
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,000
Each element relationship
is one equation.

460
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,660
So the current source gets to
say current equals x, current

461
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,000
equals 1 Amp.

462
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,400
It doesn't get to tell you
what the voltage is.

463
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,850
So being a little more physical
to try to address

464
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,480
your question more physically,
there are processes that can

465
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,970
be extremely well modeled
as current generators.

466
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,120
In fact, many electronic
semiconductor parts, like

467
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,890
transistors, work more like
a current source than like

468
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,790
anything else.

469
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,590
So there are devices that behave
as though they were

470
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,570
current sources, but they don't
simultaneously get to

471
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,390
tell you what is their current
and what is their voltage.

472
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,245
They only get to tell you
what is their current.

473
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:55,960

474
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,630
So let's think about now, if
you had a more complicated

475
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,930
system, how could you
systematically go about

476
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,580
finding the solution?

477
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,430
As was mentioned earlier,
there's something called

478
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,110
Kirchhoff's law.

479
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,060
And in fact, there's
two of them.

480
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,500
Kirchhoff's voltage law and
Kirchhoff's current law.

481
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,280
Kirchhoff's voltage law, in its
most elementary form, says

482
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,790
that if you trace the path
around any closed path in a

483
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,450
circuit, regardless of
what the path is--

484
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,040
every closed path--

485
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,650
the sum of the voltages going
around that closed path is 0.

486
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,830
So for example in this
circuit, the red path

487
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,130
illustrates one closed path
through the circuit.

488
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,680
It goes up through the voltage
source, down through this

489
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,900
resistor, and then down
through that resistor.

490
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,160
Kirchhoff's voltage law says the
sum of the voltages around

491
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,990
that loop is 0.

492
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,150
That's written mathematically
here, minus v1 for here, plus

493
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,850
v2 for here, plus v4
for here is 0.

494
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,660
OK, where do the signs
come from?

495
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,570
The signs came from the
reference directions that we

496
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,730
assigned arbitrarily
to the elements.

497
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,280
Before I ever do a circuits
question, I always assign a

498
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,520
reference direction.

499
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,125
Every voltage has a
positive terminal

500
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,120
and a negative terminal.

501
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,210
And I must be consistent in
order to apply these rules.

502
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,800
These rules only work if I
declare a reference direction

503
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,320
and stick with it.

504
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,350
If midway through a problem
I flip it, I'll

505
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,810
get the wrong answer.

506
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,220
So the minus sign has to do with
the fact that as I trace

507
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,730
this path, I enter the minus
part of this guy, but the plus

508
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,200
part of that guy and that guy.

509
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,250
So the sign of v1 is negated
relative to the others.

510
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,220

511
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,510
A different way to think about
that is here, we can think

512
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,330
that v1 is the sum
of v2 and v4.

513
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,700
That's sometimes more intuitive
because if you

514
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,280
started here, going through
this path you would end up

515
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,540
with a voltage that is v1 higher
than where you started.

516
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,580
Whereas starting here, you would
end up with a voltage

517
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,030
here that's v4 higher than
where you started.

518
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,400
And then by the time you got to
here, it would be v2 plus

519
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,970
v4 higher than where
you started.

520
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,030
You start one place and on one
route, you end up v1 higher.

521
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,030
And in the other route, you
get v4 plus v2 higher.

522
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,120
So it must be the case that v1
is the same as v2 plus v4.

523
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,620

524
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,710
Those are absolutely
equivalent ways of

525
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,990
thinking about it.

526
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,650
So those laws are equivalent.

527
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,600
If you think about it
a path, you think

528
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,305
about some of the paths--

529
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:43,780
no.

530
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,700
The path coinciding with the
negative direction of some of

531
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,750
the elements and the positive
direction of others.

532
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,030

533
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:58,720
OK, how many other
paths are there?

534
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,090
Take 20 seconds, talk
to your neighbor.

535
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,630
Figure out all of the
possible paths for

536
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,120
which KVL has to apply.

537
00:26:06,120 --> 00:28:35,850

538
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,450
OK, so everybody raise your
hand and show a number of

539
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,130
fingers equal to the number
of KVL equations less two.

540
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,060

541
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,000
Oh, very good.

542
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,170
Virtually 100% correct.

543
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,420
Why do you all say (5)?

544
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,760

545
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Which is to say 7.

546
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,010
Why do you all say 7?

547
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,970

548
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,650
So there's 3 obvious ones.

549
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,660
I was expecting a
couple of 3's.

550
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,230
This was supposed to be--

551
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,930
OK, yeah, I do plot
against you.

552
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,410
I was expecting some 3's.

553
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,770
So there's 3 obvious paths
that are analogous to the

554
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,620
first one we looked at.

555
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,980
If I call the first path A, then
there's B and C which are

556
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,030
the excursions around here.

557
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,850
And you can write the equations
just the same.

558
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,030
They each involve
three voltages.

559
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,620
And they each go through, some
starting at the negative side

560
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,720
and some starting at
the positive side.

561
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,230
So those are in some sense,
the obvious ones.

562
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,040
But there are others too.

563
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,370
So one way to think about it,
what I'd like you to do is

564
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,290
enumerate all the paths
through the circuit.

565
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,640
I should have said all the paths
through the circuit that

566
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,300
go through each element
one or fewer times.

567
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,660
I don't want you to go through
the same element twice.

568
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,280
So here's another path that
would go through elements at

569
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,290
most one time.

570
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,230
So up through here, over through
here, which didn't go

571
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,050
through any elements.

572
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,480
Down through that element,
across that, down through

573
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,850
here, et cetera.

574
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,090
And you get an equation
for that.

575
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,950
Here's another.

576
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,140
Here's another.

577
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,830
Here's another.

578
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,220
And if you try to think about a
general rule, a general rule

579
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,410
is something like, how many of
those panels can you make and

580
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,790
piece together where the loop
goes through the perimeter?

581
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,970
You're not allowed to go through
an inner place because

582
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,430
if you went through an inner
node, you'd have to

583
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,770
go through it twice.

584
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,550
If you wanted the path to go
through an inner element,

585
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,340
you'd have to go through
that element twice.

586
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,810
So in fact, the answer is 7.

587
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:49,200
There are 7 different paths
according to Kirchhoff's

588
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,970
voltage law, all of which the
sum of the voltages around

589
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,505
those paths has to be 0.

590
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:56,080

591
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,260
The problem is, of course, that
those equations are not

592
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,625
all linearly independent.

593
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,030

594
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,280
So if you just had a general
purpose equation solver-- and

595
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,330
by the way, we'll write
one of those in week

596
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,970
8 for solving circuits.

597
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,400
If you just passed those 7
equations into a general

598
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,410
purpose equation solver, it
would tell you there's

599
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,010
something awry with your
equations because they're not

600
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,800
linearly independent.

601
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,140
So you can, however, think about
linearly independent in

602
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,050
particularly simple cases.

603
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,140
This network is a particular
kind of network that we call a

604
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,070
planar network.

605
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,680
A planar network is one that I
can draw on a sheet of paper

606
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,570
without crossing wires.

607
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,040
So I can draw this network
without crossing wires.

608
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,410
I'll call it planar.

609
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,080
And it turns out that
Kirchhoff's voltage laws for

610
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,200
the innermost loops are always
independent of each other.

611
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,490
That's kind of obvious because
as you go to a --

612
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,940
so each loop contains at least
one element that some other

613
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,460
loop didn't have.

614
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,620
So that's kind of the reasoning
for why it works.

615
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,510
So if you think about this
particular loop, which we

616
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:13,370
included in the 7, you can think
about that as being the

617
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,020
sum of the loops this way, the
A loop and the B loop.

618
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,360
Because if you write KVL for the
A loop and KVL for the B

619
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,980
loop and add them, you end up
deriving KVL for the more

620
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,220
complicated path.

621
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,190
And if you think about what's
going on, it's not anything

622
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,880
terribly magical.

623
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,850
This path is the same as the A
path added to that path, where

624
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,900
I went through this element down
when I did the A path and

625
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,610
up when I did the B path.

626
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,230
So those parts canceled out.

627
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,420
That was the rule that I was
talking about how I don't

628
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,480
really want to go through the
same element twice when I'm

629
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,970
applying KVL.

630
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,280
So the idea then is that there's
a systematic way, an

631
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,170
easy way to figure out
all the KVL loops.

632
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,765
You just think about
all the possible

633
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,360
paths through the circuit.

634
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,210
You do have to worry about
linearly independent.

635
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,440
In the case of planar networks,
that's pretty

636
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,220
straightforward.

637
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,510
Planar networks, you can always
figure out the linearly

638
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,770
independent KVL equations by
looking at the smallest

639
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,140
possible loops.

640
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,960
The loops with small area.

641
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,250
OK, so that's half of it.

642
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:28,960
That's KVL.

643
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,650
The other Kirchhoff's law is
KCL, Kirchhoff's Current Law.

644
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,250

645
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,760
There we are thinking of
the flow of current.

646
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,770
So the flow of current is
analogous to the flow of

647
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,560
incompressible fluid.

648
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,960
Water, for example.

649
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,310
If you trace the amount of water
that flows through a

650
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,560
pipe that goes into a Y, then
the sum of the flows out has

651
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,660
to equal the flow in.

652
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,710
If that weren't true, the water
would be building up.

653
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,860
So we think about pipes as
transporting the flow of water

654
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,270
without allowing it to
build up anywhere.

655
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,956
That's precisely how we
think about wires

656
00:34:10,956 --> 00:34:13,650
in electrical circuits.

657
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,540
The wires allow the transport
of electrons but don't allow

658
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,770
the buildup of electrons.

659
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,820
OK, do electrons build up?

660
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,000
Sure.

661
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,219
But in our idealized world, we
say they don't build up in the

662
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,130
wires, they build
up in a part.

663
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,010
And we'll have a special
part that allows the

664
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,570
electrons to build up.

665
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,749
So we're not excluding the
possibility that they build

666
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:41,840
up, we're just saying that in
this formalism, we don't allow

667
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,540
the electrons to build
up in the wires.

668
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,090
So for the purpose of the wires,
current in is equal to

669
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,630
the current out.

670
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,949
The net current in is 0.

671
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:57,360
So we will think then, about
the circuit having nodes.

672
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,300
The nodes are the places where
more than one element meets,

673
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,980
two or more elements meet.

674
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,790
And we will apply KCL
at each node.

675
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,650
So for example, in this simple
circuit where I would have

676
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:18,010
three parts connected in what
we would call parallel, they

677
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,330
share a node at the
top and they share

678
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,620
a node at the bottom.

679
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,870
So even though it looks like
there's multiple interconnects

680
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,290
up here, we say that's
one node.

681
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,430

682
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,940
And we would say that the sum of
the currents into the node

683
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,810
is equal to the sum of
the currents out.

684
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,960
So if I lab all of the possible
currents that come

685
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,160
out of that node, I would
have i1, i2, i3.

686
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,685
i1 goes through the first
one, the second one

687
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,100
and the third one.

688
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,300
And so I would conclude from
Kirchhoff's current law that

689
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,340
the sum of i1, i2,
and i3 is 0.

690
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:51,720
OK.

691
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,670
Easy, right?

692
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,380
As I said, we're going to make
an abstraction where the

693
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,620
electrons don't build
up in the wires.

694
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,190
They don't even build
up in the parts.

695
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,330
They do get stored
in the parts.

696
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,230
That's a little confusing,
we'll come back to that.

697
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,540
If they don't build up in the
parts, then the current that

698
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,720
goes in this leg has to
come out that leg.

699
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,920

700
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,930
If that's true, then i1 is i4,
i2 is i5, i3 is i6, and we end

701
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,030
up with another equation down
here, which turns out to be

702
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,900
precisely the same as
the one at the top.

703
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,380

704
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,790
Everybody's happy with that?

705
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,550
So we're thinking about this
just the way we would think

706
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,650
about water flow.

707
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,840
If there's water flow into a
part, it better be coming out.

708
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,750
If there's water flow in a pipe,
the water that goes into

709
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,830
the pipe better come out
of the pipe someplace.

710
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,700
So here is an arbitrary network

711
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,340
made out of four parts.

712
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,070
How many linearly independent
KCL equations are there?

713
00:36:57,070 --> 00:38:20,810

714
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,740
So how many linearly independent
KCL equations are

715
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,280
in that network?

716
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Everyone raise your hand, some
number of KCL equations.

717
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,125

718
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,250
OK, I'm seeing a
bigger variety.

719
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,170
I see (1)'s, (2)'s, and (3)'s.

720
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,200
I don't see any (4)'s.

721
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,515
That's probably good.

722
00:38:40,515 --> 00:38:43,400

723
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,600
So how do you think about the
number of linearly independent

724
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,850
KCL equations?

725
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,945

726
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:55,860
So the first thing to do
is to label things.

727
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,430

728
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,660
So you have to have reference
directions before you can sort

729
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,250
of think about things.

730
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,540
So we have four elements.

731
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,900
We would be expecting to see
four element currents.

732
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,800
The same current that goes
into an element has

733
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,460
to come out of it.

734
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,080
So there's element current
1, 2, 3, and 4.

735
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,490

736
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,230
There are three nodes,
so we might be

737
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,680
expecting three KCL equations.

738
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,190
Here's one node from which you
would conclude that the sum of

739
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,520
i1 and i2 better be 0.

740
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
Here's a node from which you
would conclude that the

741
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,890
current in i2 better
be i3 plus i4.

742
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:41,440
And here is a node from which
you would conclude that i1

743
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,230
plus i3 plus i4 is 0.

744
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,380
So I can write one KCL equation
for every node,

745
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,840
that's not surprising.

746
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,820
But if you look at those
equations, you'll see that

747
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,390
they're not linearly
independent.

748
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,710
In fact, if you solve
this one for i2--

749
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,150
it's already solved for i2.

750
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,910
Stick that answer up here, you
get i3 plus i4 added to i1 is

751
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,590
0, which is just the same
as that equation.

752
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,540
So of those three equations,
only two of them are linearly

753
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,090
independent.

754
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,525
The answer to that
problem was (2).

755
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:18,820

756
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,920
And there's a pattern.

757
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,690
So think about the pattern in
terms of figuring out the

758
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,320
number of linearly independent
KCL equations that are in a

759
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,735
slightly more complicated
network.

760
00:40:27,735 --> 00:42:00,512

761
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:05,880
So what's the answer
here, how many KCL

762
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,270
equations are in this network?

763
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,040

764
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,290
Wow.

765
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,160

766
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,020
Well, I'm not getting any of the
answers I would have said.

767
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,776
What does that mean?

768
00:42:20,776 --> 00:42:23,550
Ah, I'm forgetting to add 2.

769
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,270
That's my problem.

770
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,370
OK, now I'm getting some of
the answers that I would

771
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:27,980
expect to get.

772
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,080
OK, got it.

773
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,730
I confused myself.

774
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,910
OK, the vast majority say (1).

775
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,640
How do you get that?

776
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,890
Which is 3.

777
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,574

778
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:45,740
So again, you think of how in
this circuit there are four

779
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,880
nodes, A, B, C, D. So we can
think about writing a KCL

780
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,060
equation for each one.

781
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,450
If we go to A, A has three
currents coming out of it --

782
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,360
1, 2, 3.

783
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,910
So the sum of those has
to be 0, et cetera.

784
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,010
And if you think about those
equations, they're not

785
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,450
linearly independent either.

786
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,010

787
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,250
If you work through the math,
you see that there's exactly

788
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,330
one of those equations that
you can eliminate.

789
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,350
So you're left with
three linearly

790
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,250
independent KCL equations.

791
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,210
And so there's a pattern
emerging here.

792
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,460
Somebody see the pattern?

793
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,540

794
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,520
1 minus.

795
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,770
Can somebody prove
the pattern?

796
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,560

797
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,520
So there's a pattern here.

798
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,810
The pattern is take the number
of nodes and the number of

799
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,910
independent KCL equations
as one less.

800
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,480

801
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,398
So the challenge is,
can you prove it?

802
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:46,390

803
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,640
And by the theory
of lectures--

804
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,858

805
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:51,356
AUDIENCE: Yes.

806
00:43:51,356 --> 00:43:53,350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

807
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,510
And by a corollary of the theory
of lectures, the way

808
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,010
you would prove it is?

809
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,970
AUDIENCE: On the next slide.

810
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:58,980
PROFESSOR: On the next slide.

811
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,230
Exactly.

812
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,960

813
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,210
So how do I prove it?

814
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,958

815
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:08,930
Yeah?

816
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,395
AUDIENCE: Whenever you take
minus 1, you just add all the

817
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:12,650
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] together
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

818
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:12,910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

819
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,312
So there's something special
about the last one.

820
00:44:15,312 --> 00:44:17,304
Why should there be something
special about the last one.

821
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:19,296
AUDIENCE: Because the
circuit's closed.

822
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:22,504
PROFESSOR: Because the
circuit's closed.

823
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:23,760
That's right.

824
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,230
So the idea is to sort
of generalize the way

825
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,480
we think about KCL.

826
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,690

827
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,710
So we start with a circuit.

828
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,840
We think about having
four nodes here.

829
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,270
It's certainly the case that
KCL holds for each node.

830
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,376
So here's KCL for that node.

831
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:46,830
But now if you think about KCL
for this node, and then add

832
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:51,180
them, that looks like
a KCL equation.

833
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,850

834
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,200
But it applies to
a super node.

835
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,520
Imagine the node defined by the
black box, and think about

836
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,293
the net currents into or
out of the black node.

837
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:08,470

838
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:13,940
This current i2, which leaves
the red node, enters the green

839
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,890
node, but doesn't go through
the surface of the

840
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,520
black node at all.

841
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,600
That's exactly the current
that's subtracted out when we

842
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,986
added the red equation to
the green equation.

843
00:45:26,986 --> 00:45:28,940
Does that make sense?

844
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,090
So KCL says, oh, if all the
currents at a node have to sum

845
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:40,380
to 0, and if elements have the
same current coming out and

846
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:48,560
going in, then if you draw a
box around an element, what

847
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,000
goes into the element
is the same as what

848
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,240
comes out of the element.

849
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,340
It doesn't change the net
current through the surface.

850
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,890
So the generalization of the KCL
equation, KCL says the sum

851
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,450
of the currents into
a node is 0.

852
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:06,690
The generalization says take any
closed path in a circuit,

853
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:11,630
the sum of the currents going
across that closed path is 0.

854
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,600
So if we apply that rule again,
think about node 3.

855
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,470
If we add the result of node 3
to the black node, which was

856
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:25,170
the sum of 1 and 2, we get
the new green curve.

857
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,340
We get the new green equation.

858
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,720
And what that says is the sum
of the currents going across

859
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,120
the green super node--

860
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,530
OK, so what's going on? i1 is
coming out of it, i4 is coming

861
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,330
out of it, i5 is coming
out of it.

862
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,540
So the sum of i1, i4,
and i5 has to be 0.

863
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,570

864
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,030
Well, KCL says the sum of the
currents coming out of a

865
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,890
node must be 0.

866
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,990
The super KCL says the sum of
the currents coming out of any

867
00:46:54,990 --> 00:47:00,180
closed region is also 0.

868
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,840
But the interesting thing about
this closed region is

869
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,425
that it encloses all but
one of the nodes.

870
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:09,230

871
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,310
That's always true.

872
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,150
Regardless of the system,
regardless of the circuit, you

873
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:19,090
can always draw a line that will
isolate one node from all

874
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,030
the others.

875
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:25,825
So what that proves is that you
can always write KCL for

876
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:28,920
this node in terms of
KCL for those nodes.

877
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,870

878
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:31,965
Ok.

879
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,770
So there's a generalization then
that says that you can

880
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:40,120
always write KCL
for every node.

881
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,130
They will always be linearly
dependent.

882
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,580
So you can always
throw away one.

883
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,780

884
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,690
So in some sense now,
we're done.

885
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,840
We've just finished
circuit theory.

886
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,060
We talked about how every
element has to have a law.

887
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,470
A resistor is Ohm's Law.

888
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,820
A voltage source says that the
voltage across the terminals

889
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,295
is always a constant.

890
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:02,730
A current source says that the
current through the current

891
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,530
source is always a constant.

892
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:07,380
So every element tells
you one law.

893
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,170

894
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,760
We know how to think
about KVL.

895
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,930
So we know the rule for how the
across variables behave.

896
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,230
What's the aggregate behavior
of all the across variables?

897
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,140
Well, KVL has to be satisfied
for every possible loop.

898
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,430
The loops don't have
to be independent.

899
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,620
You have to worry about whether
they're independent.

900
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,020
The only simple rule we came up
with-- we'll come up with

901
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,415
another one in a moment.

902
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:35,340
The only simple rule that we
came up with was for planar

903
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,410
circuits, where the innermost
loops were linearly

904
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,720
independent of each other.

905
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,280
And you have to write KCL for
all the nodes, except one.

906
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,530
One of them never matters.

907
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,110

908
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,210
So in some sense, we're done.

909
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,450
What we would do to
solve the circuit,

910
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,310
think about every element.

911
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:59,240
For every element assign a
voltage, a reference voltage.

912
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,570
For every element,
assign a current.

913
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,460
Make sure they go in the
right direction.

914
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,460
We always define currents
to go down

915
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,070
the potential gradient.

916
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,920
They always go in the directions
through the element

917
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,840
from the positive
to the negative.

918
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,610
So for every element, assign
a current and a voltage.

919
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,420
We have 6 elements, that's
12 unknowns.

920
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,370
Now we dig and we find
12 equations.

921
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:28,980
In this particular circuit, we
found those 12 equations.

922
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,505
There were three KCL equations,
one for each of the

923
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:32,550
inner loops.

924
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,420
There were three KCL equations,
one for each node

925
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,080
except one.

926
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,020
There were 5 Ohm's law
equations, one for each one of

927
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,750
the resistors.

928
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,390
There was one source equation
for the voltage source.

929
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:49,120
12 equations, 12 unknowns,
we're done.

930
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,900
The only problem is a
lot of equations.

931
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,500
It's not a very complicated
circuit.

932
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,430
We've only got 6 elements.

933
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,580
I tried to motivate this in
terms of studying networks

934
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,390
that had 10 to the 9 elements.

935
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,750
This technique is not
particularly great

936
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,920
at 10 to the 9.

937
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,240
It would probably work.

938
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,130
But we would probably
be interested in

939
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,970
finding simpler ways.

940
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,430
So there are simpler ways you
might imagine, and we'll

941
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:24,680
discuss two of them
just very briefly.

942
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,160
The dumb way that I just talked
about is what we call

943
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,190
primitive variables,
element variables.

944
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,600
If you write all the element
variables, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5

945
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,480
v6, all of the element currents,
i1, i2, i3, i4, i5,

946
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,630
i6, write all the equations,
you can solve it.

947
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,620
However, if you're judicious,
you can figure out a smaller

948
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,600
number of unknowns and a
correspondingly smaller number

949
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,340
of equations.

950
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,640
One method is called
the node method.

951
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,180

952
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,400
When we're thinking about the
individual elements, the thing

953
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,465
that matters is the voltage
across the element.

954
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:59,230

955
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:02,130
However, that's not
the easy way to

956
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:06,140
write the circuit equations.

957
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:10,110
A much easier way is not to tell
me the voltage across an

958
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:13,360
element, but instead tell me
the voltage associated with

959
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,610
each of the nodes.

960
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,710

961
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,400
If I tell you the voltage
associated with every node,

962
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,930
the important thing about that
way of defining the variables

963
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,040
is that you're guaranteed that
from those variables, you can

964
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,360
tell me the voltage
across every part.

965
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,630
So for example, in this circuit,
this voltage source--

966
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:42,140
so if I call this one ground,
we'll always have a magic node

967
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,410
called ground.

968
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,490
It is not special
in the least.

969
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,780
It's just the reference
voltage.

970
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,610
I'll come back to that.

971
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,400
I'll say words in a minute about
what the reference is.

972
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,100
We always get to declare
one node to be ground.

973
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,270
We get one free node.

974
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:04,830
It's a node whose voltage we
don't care about because it's

975
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,380
the reference for
all voltages.

976
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,260
It's a node whose current we
don't care about because we

977
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,370
get to throw away one node when
we do current equations.

978
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:15,400
So we have one special mode
called ground, about which we

979
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,660
don't care too much.

980
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,900
Except that it's the most
important node in the circuit.

981
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,650
Except for that, we don't
care about it.

982
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,430
So this guy's ground.

983
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:26,080
We think about its
voltage being 0.

984
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,360
Then this voltage supply
makes that node be v0.

985
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,250
I don't know what that is,
so I'll call it e1.

986
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:36,340
And I don't know what that
is, so I'll call it e2.

987
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,600
So if I tell you the voltage on
all of those nodes, ground

988
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,550
voltage is 0, the top voltage is
v0, the left voltage is e1,

989
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,670
the right voltage is e2.

990
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:51,700
From those four numbers, 0 and
3 nontrivial numbers, you can

991
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,940
find all of the component
voltages.

992
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,460
So for example, the voltage v6,
the voltage across R6 is

993
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,710
e2 minus e1.

994
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,420

995
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,740
The voltage v4, the voltage
across the R4

996
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,470
resistor is e1 minus 0.

997
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,690
So if I tell you all the node
voltages, you can tell me all

998
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,250
of the element voltages.

999
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,530
And in general, there's fewer
nodes than there are

1000
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,560
components.

1001
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,820
OK, that's great.

1002
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,990
So instead of naming the volts
across the elements, we'll

1003
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:30,115
name the voltages at the nodes
because there's fewer of them.

1004
00:53:30,115 --> 00:53:32,750

1005
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,620
Then, all we need to do in the
node method is write the

1006
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:42,780
minimum number of
KCL equations.

1007
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,060
We know we only have two
unknowns, e1 and e2.

1008
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,970
And it turns out-- and you
can prove this, but I

1009
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,990
won't prove it today.

1010
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:54,000
It turns out that you need
two KCL equations.

1011
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,670
Two unknowns, e1, e2,
two KCL equations.

1012
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,400
And it turns out those two KCL
equations are exactly the KCL

1013
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,400
equations associated
with the two nodes.

1014
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,950

1015
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,990
So the current leaving
e1, so KCL at e1 --

1016
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,780
well, there's a current
that goes that way.

1017
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,080
Well, that's the voltage drop
in going from e1 to v0, e1

1018
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,380
minus v0, divided by R2.

1019
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,610
That's Ohm's law.

1020
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:28,600
So this term represents the
current going up that leg plus

1021
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,930
the current that goes through
this leg, which is e1

1022
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,780
minus e2 over R6.

1023
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,450
Plus the current going in
that leg, which is e1

1024
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:39,250
minus 0 over R4.

1025
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,980
The sum of those three
currents better be 0.

1026
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,640

1027
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,460
Analogously, the sum of the
currents at this node must be

1028
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:50,070
0, and the equation looks
virtually the same.

1029
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:56,230
Because v0 is known, so it
didn't add an unknown.

1030
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:00,250
v0 was set by the voltage,
by the voltage source.

1031
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:04,000
So I have two equations,
two unknowns, solved.

1032
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,630
Done.

1033
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:07,040
So rather than solving 12
equations and 12 unknowns, I

1034
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,300
can do it with two equations
and two unknowns.

1035
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,640
That's called the node method.

1036
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,610
One of the most interesting
theories about circuits is

1037
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:19,110
that every simplification that
you can think about for

1038
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,250
voltage has an analogous
simplification that you can

1039
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,050
think about in current.

1040
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:24,030
That's called duality.

1041
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,430
We won't do that because it's
kind of complicated.

1042
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,790
But it's kind of
a cute result.

1043
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,500
If you can think of a
simplification that works in

1044
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,920
voltage, then there is
an analogous one, and

1045
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,200
you can prove it.

1046
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,860
In fact, you can formally derive
what it must have been.

1047
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,090

1048
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,970
This is a rule for how you can
simplify things by thinking

1049
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,115
about voltages in aggregate.

1050
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:47,640

1051
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,480
Rather than thinking about the
element voltages, think about

1052
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,890
the node voltages.

1053
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:56,510
The analogous current law is
rather than thinking about the

1054
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:59,770
currents through the elements,
the element currents, think

1055
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,950
about loop currents.

1056
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,110
OK, that's a little bizarre.

1057
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,430
So we name the loop, the current
that flows in this

1058
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:12,590
loop, IA, the current that flows
in this loop, IB, and

1059
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,780
the current hat flows
in this loop, IC.

1060
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,280
What on earth is he doing?

1061
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,250
Well, the element voltages are
some linear combination of

1062
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,070
those loop currents.

1063
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,460
And in fact, the coefficients in
the linear combination are

1064
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,660
one and minus one.

1065
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:32,320
So the element current I4, the
current that flows through the

1066
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,780
R4 resistor is the sum of
IA coming down minus IC,

1067
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,670
which is going up.

1068
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:45,500
So there's a way of thinking
about each element current as

1069
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:49,790
a sum or difference of
the loop currents.

1070
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,180
Everybody get that?

1071
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,600
So instead of thinking about
the individual element

1072
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,190
currents, I think about
the loop currents.

1073
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,900
And now, I need to write
three KVL equations.

1074
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,730
So in the node method, I named
the nodes and had to write two

1075
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,480
KCL equations.

1076
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,205
Here, I named the loop currents
and I have to write

1077
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:15,590
three KVL equations,
one for each loop.

1078
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,760
It's completely analogous.

1079
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,420
If you write out a sentence,
what did you do?

1080
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,760
I assigned a voltage to every
node, and I wrote

1081
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,910
KCL of all the nodes.

1082
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:26,040
Then if you turn the word
"current" into the word

1083
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,540
"voltage," the word "node"
into the word "loop," you

1084
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,920
derive this new method.

1085
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,340
So this says that if I write KVL
at the A loop, think about

1086
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,580
spinning around this loop, as
I go up through the voltage

1087
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,910
source, so I go in the negative
terminal here.

1088
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,090
So that's minus v0.

1089
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,940
As I go down through this
resistor, I have to use Ohm's

1090
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,770
law, so that's R2 times
the down current.

1091
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:57,610
Well, the down current is
IA down minus IB up.

1092
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,380
So I went up through here,
down through here.

1093
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,160
Now I go down through
this one.

1094
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,580
When I go down through that one,
according to Ohm's law,

1095
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,530
that's R4 times the current
through that element.

1096
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:13,490
That current-- well, it's
IA down and it's IC up.

1097
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:18,650
So this is the KVL equation
for that loop.

1098
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:23,030
I write two more of them, and I
end up with three equations

1099
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:25,590
and three unknowns.

1100
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,410
Both the node method and the
loop method resulted in a lot

1101
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,330
fewer equations than
the primitives did.

1102
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:38,400
I had 12 primitive unknowns,
6 voltages and 6 currents.

1103
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,670
In the node method, I get the
number of independent nodes as

1104
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,910
the number of equations and
unknowns, which is less than

1105
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,520
the number of primitive
variables.

1106
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,280
In the loop method, I have the
number of independent loops.

1107
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,840

1108
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,100
Which is again, smaller.

1109
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,220
So the idea then is that we have
a couple of ways to think

1110
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,360
about solving circuits.

1111
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,450
Fundamentally, all we have are
the element relationships and

1112
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,846
the rules for combination.

1113
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:09,180
Oh, this is starting to sound
like PCAP, primitives and

1114
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,380
combinations.

1115
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,860
So the primitives are, how does
the element constrain the

1116
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,260
voltages and currents?

1117
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,470
We know three of those,
Ohm's law, voltage

1118
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,480
source, current source.

1119
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,380
And what are the rules
for combination?

1120
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,010
Well, the currents add to the
node, and the voltages add

1121
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,070
around loops.

1122
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:33,720
OK, just to make sure you've
absorb all that, figure out

1123
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,535
the current I for
this circuit.

1124
00:59:35,535 --> 01:02:31,840

1125
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,810
OK, what's a good
way to start?

1126
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:38,830
What should I do to start
thinking about calculating I?

1127
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,190
OK, bad way.

1128
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,520
Assign voltages and currents
to everything.

1129
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,150
4 elements, that's 4 voltages,
4 currents.

1130
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,620
That's 8 unknowns.

1131
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,990
Find 8 equations, solve.

1132
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,200
That'll work.

1133
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:50,980
Bad way.

1134
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,230
What's a better way?

1135
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:56,146

1136
01:02:56,146 --> 01:02:57,396
OK, [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1137
01:02:57,396 --> 01:03:00,986

the previous sheet.

1140

[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1141
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,020
AUDIENCE: KVL [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1142
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,660
PROFESSOR: KVL for where?

1143
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,616
AUDIENCE: Loops.

1144
01:03:11,616 --> 01:03:12,594
PROFESSOR: Which loop?

1145
01:03:12,594 --> 01:03:13,572
AUDIENCE: Left loop.

1146
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:16,506
PROFESSOR: So do KVL
on the left loop?

1147
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:17,973
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1148
01:03:17,973 --> 01:03:19,440
PROFESSOR: OK, that's good.

1149
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,090
But you have to tell me how
to assign variables.

1150
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,273
Do you want 8 primitive
variables?

1151
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:28,540

1152
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,920
8 primitive variables are v1,
i1, v2, i2, v3, i3, v4, i4.

1153
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,130

1154
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:38,540
So that's what I mean by
primitive variables.

1155
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,700
Or element variables is
another word for it.

1156
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,555
What's a better way than using
element variables?

1157
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:47,552

1158
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:48,000
Yeah.

1159
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,908
AUDIENCE: Create 2
loop equations.

1160
01:03:49,908 --> 01:03:52,902
PROFESSOR: Create 2 loop
equations, that's fantastic.

1161
01:03:52,902 --> 01:03:54,950
AUDIENCE: I1 for the first loop,
I2 for the second loop.

1162
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:58,750
PROFESSOR: So if you do I1 going
around here, then I1 is

1163
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:05,915
actually I. And if you do I2
going around here, what's I2?

1164
01:04:05,915 --> 01:04:10,673

1165
01:04:10,673 --> 01:04:11,670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1166
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:16,490
PROFESSOR: So if I think about
I2 spinning around this loop,

1167
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:20,920
so the sum of I1 and I2
goes through that box.

1168
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,200
But the only current that goes
through this box is?

1169
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,556

1170
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:27,806
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1171
01:04:27,806 --> 01:04:29,993

1172
01:04:29,993 --> 01:04:31,957
PROFESSOR: So the suggestion
is that I think about--

1173
01:04:31,957 --> 01:04:43,250

1174
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:49,790
so if I have I1 here, but I know
that's I. Then I can see

1175
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,310
immediately that since
the only current that

1176
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,380
goes through here--

1177
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,100
so if I have I1 and I2.

1178
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,010
That was a very clever idea.

1179
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,090
If you have I1 and I2, the only
current that goes through

1180
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:02,470
here is I. So I1
must've been I.

1181
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,640
The only current that
goes over here

1182
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,390
must've been this guy.

1183
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:11,340
So this must be minus 10.

1184
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,130
So I could redo that this way.

1185
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:19,130
I could say I've got
10 going that way.

1186
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,410
That make sense?

1187
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:26,340
So now I only have one unknown
which is I. So that's a very

1188
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,310
clever way of doing it.

1189
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,720
So what I could do
is showed here.

1190
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,180
I have I going around one
loop and I have 10

1191
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,950
going around that loop.

1192
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:39,950
That completely specifies
all the currents.

1193
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:43,080
So now all I need to
do is write KVL for

1194
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,980
these different cases.

1195
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:50,810
So if I write KVL for the left
loop, then I get going up

1196
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:55,160
through here, that's minus 15,
and going down through here,

1197
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,360
going to the right through
this guy is 3I.

1198
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,090
Going down through this guy
is 2 times I plus 10.

1199
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:05,450
Both of these are going down,
so you have to add them.

1200
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:10,010

1201
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:11,960
So I get one equation
and one unknown.

1202
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,160
And when I solve it,
I get minus one.

1203
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,410
That make sense?

1204
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:18,470

1205
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:19,900
There's an analogous
way you could have

1206
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,150
done it with one node.

1207
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:24,080

1208
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,130
You could have said that the
circuit has a single node and

1209
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,860
figured out KCL for
that one node.

1210
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,170
KCL would be the sum of
the currents here.

1211
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,770
There's a current that
goes that way, that

1212
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,880
way, and that way.

1213
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,240
And again, you end up with
1 equation and 1 unknown.

1214
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,069
Yes?

1215

1217
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:46,808
PROFESSOR: Correct.

1218
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:49,051

1219
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,430
If I thought about this current
going this way, it

1220
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,890
would be minus 10.

1221
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:59,050
If I flipped the direction,
then it's plus 10.

1222
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,820
So the loop current has the
property that it's the only

1223
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,290
current through this element.

1224
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,220
So that has to match.

1225
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:11,234
It's one of two currents that
go through this element.

1226
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:13,186
AUDIENCE: You said that
everything that

1227
01:07:13,186 --> 01:07:15,626
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1228
01:07:15,626 --> 01:07:17,578
PROFESSOR: This loop is
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1229
01:07:17,578 --> 01:07:18,066
Yes.

1230
01:07:18,066 --> 01:07:20,018
AUDIENCE: So why is the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1231
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:23,434

1232
01:07:23,434 --> 01:07:24,410
PROFESSOR: Correct.

1233
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:26,880
I want to have this
picture now.

1234
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,570
So if I'm doing it with loops,
I have two loops.

1235
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:32,390

1236
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,100
The current through this element
is just I. The current

1237
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,720
through this element is just
I. The current through this

1238
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,020
element is just 10.

1239
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,040
The current through this
element-- well, the sum of

1240
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,560
these two currents go through
that element.

1241
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,730

1242
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,512
Does that make sense?

1243
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:50,762
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1244
01:07:50,762 --> 01:07:55,428

1245
01:07:55,428 --> 01:07:57,893
PROFESSOR: This loop current
is just a fraction of the

1246
01:07:57,893 --> 01:08:01,344
current in the whole system.

1247
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:05,550
So this loop current goes
through this element and

1248
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,150
contributes to this element.

1249
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,400
But so does that one.

1250
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,074

1251
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:15,150
OK, if you're still confused,
you should try to get it

1252
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,170
straightened out in one of the
software labs or the hardware

1253
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:18,670
lab, or talk to me
after lecture.

1254
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:20,760
But the idea is to
decompose in the

1255
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,720
case of the node voltages.

1256
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,380
Think about the element
voltages in terms of

1257
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,000
differences in the
node voltages.

1258
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,580

1259
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,439
In the case of the loop
currents, think about the

1260
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:36,100
element currents in terms of
a sum of loop currents.

1261
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:40,029

1262
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:43,600
OK, so the answer is minus 1
regardless of how you do it.

1263
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,345

1264
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:46,472
Ok.

1265
01:08:46,472 --> 01:08:49,439
The remaining thing I want to
do today is think about

1266
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,140
abstraction.

1267
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,180
We've talked about the
primitives, which are things

1268
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,750
like resistors, voltage sources,
and current sources.

1269
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:03,100
Means of combinations,
that's KVL and KCL.

1270
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,090
Now we want to think
about abstraction.

1271
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,700
And the first abstraction that
we'll talk about is, how do

1272
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,510
you think about one element
that represents

1273
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,680
more than one element?

1274
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,740
This is the same thing that we
did when we thought about

1275
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,770
linear systems, when we did
signals and systems.

1276
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:23,270
We started with R's and K's and
pluses, and we made single

1277
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:29,020
boxes that had lots of R's and
pluses and gains in them.

1278
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,590
What was the name of the thing
that was inside the box?

1279
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:36,270
If we combined lots of R's,
gains, and pluses into a

1280
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,860
single box, what would we call
the thing that's in the box?

1281
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,019
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1282
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:41,789
PROFESSOR: Shout again.

1283
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:42,260
AUDIENCE: System function.

1284
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,930
PROFESSOR: System function.

1285
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:45,019
Right?

1286
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:47,609
So we started with boxes
that only had

1287
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,580
things like R's in them.

1288
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:53,920
But eventually, we got boxes
that looked like much more

1289
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:00,000
complicated things like that.

1290
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,170
We thought about a system
function which was a

1291
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:06,580
generalized box, that could have
lots of R's, or lots of

1292
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,890
gains, or lots of
pluses in it.

1293
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:14,810
And that was a way of
abstracting complicated

1294
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,140
systems so they looked
like simple systems.

1295
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,900
What we want to do here is the
same thing for circuits.

1296
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,530
We want to have a single
element, a single circuit

1297
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:25,620
element, that represents
many circuit elements.

1298
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:29,240
And the simplest case of that
is for series in parallel

1299
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,050
combinations of resistors.

1300
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:34,890
It's very simple to think about
how if you had two Ohm's

1301
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:39,220
law devices connected in series,
you could replace

1302
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:42,490
those two with a single
resistor.

1303
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:45,520
And the voltage-current
relationships measured at the

1304
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,460
outside of the box would
be the same.

1305
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,140

1306
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,930
That's how we think about an
abstraction in circuits.

1307
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:59,730
When is it that you can draw
a box around a piece of a

1308
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:03,590
circuit and think about
that as one element?

1309
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:06,350
The very simplest cases, the
series combination of two

1310
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:09,940
resistors, same sort of thing
happens for the parallel

1311
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,830
combination.

1312
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:15,870
And that simple abstraction
makes some things very easy.

1313
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:19,370
What would be the equivalent
resistance for a complicated

1314
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:21,350
system like that?

1315
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,070
Well, that's easy.

1316
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:29,440
All you need to do is think
about successively reducing

1317
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,170
the pieces.

1318
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:35,050
Here I'm thinking about that
having four resistors.

1319
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:39,020
I can just successively apply
series and parallel in order

1320
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,760
to reduce that, make it
less complicated.

1321
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:47,660
So I can think about combining
these two in series to get,

1322
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:50,025
instead of two 1 Ohm resistors,
one 2 Ohm resistor.

1323
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:52,580

1324
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:56,640
Then I can think about these
two 2 Ohm resistors being

1325
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,170
equivalently one parallel
1 Ohm resistor.

1326
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:02,810

1327
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:06,170
And so this whole thing looks
as though it's just 2 Ohms

1328
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:09,560
from the outside world.

1329
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,220
That's what we mean
by an abstraction.

1330
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:15,430
What we're trying to do and what
we will do over the next

1331
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,380
two weeks, is we'll think
about ways of combining

1332
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,630
circuits so that we can reduce
the complexity this way.

1333
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,250

1334
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:28,070
Another convenient way of
thinking about reducing the

1335
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:31,120
work that you need to do is to
think about common patterns

1336
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,130
that result.

1337
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:37,740
PCAP, Primitives, Combinations,
Abstractions.

1338
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,120
So the series of parallel
idea was an abstraction.

1339
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,330
A pattern, here's a
common pattern.

1340
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:48,930
If you've got two resistors in
series, if the same current

1341
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:52,250
flows through two resistors,
then there's a way of very

1342
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:56,170
simply calculating the voltage
that falls across each.

1343
01:12:56,170 --> 01:13:01,090
So you can think about the sum
resistor, R1 plus R2 since

1344
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:03,290
they're in series.

1345
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,190
So that allows you then
to compute the

1346
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:08,390
current from the voltage.

1347
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:11,240
Then the voltage that falls
across this guy is by Ohm's

1348
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:16,000
law, just the current
times its resistor,

1349
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,150
which is like that.

1350
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:19,970
And similarly with this one.

1351
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:24,560
So you can see that some
fraction of this voltage v

1352
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,930
occurs across the v1 terminal.

1353
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:30,100
And some different fraction
appears across the v2

1354
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,770
terminal, such that the sum of
the fractions is, of course,

1355
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:38,280
v. That's what has to
happen for the two.

1356
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,260
And there's a proportional
drop.

1357
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,350
The bigger R1, the bigger is the
proportion of the voltage

1358
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,860
that falls across R1.

1359
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:49,620
So it's a simple way of thinking
about how voltage

1360
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,120
drops across two resistors.

1361
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,610
There's a completely analogous
way of thinking about how

1362
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:58,690
current splits between
two resistors.

1363
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,440
Here the result looks virtually
the same, except it

1364
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,710
has kind of the unintuitive
property that most of the

1365
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:11,710
current goes through the
resistor that is the smallest.

1366
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:19,910
So you get a bigger current in
i1 in proportion to the R2.

1367
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:23,040
So it works very much like the
voltage case, except that it

1368
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,060
has this inversion in it, that
the current likes to go

1369
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,870
through the smaller resistor.

1370
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:33,670
OK, so last problem.

1371
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:38,880
Using those kinds of ideas,
think about how you could

1372
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,855
compute the voltage v0 and
determine what's the answer.

1373
01:14:42,855 --> 01:16:30,480

1374
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,910
So what's the easy way to
think about this answer?

1375
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:35,160
What do I do first?

1376
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,912

1377
01:16:38,912 --> 01:16:40,409
AUDIENCE: Superposition.

1378
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:41,407
PROFESSOR: So superposition?

1379
01:16:41,407 --> 01:16:43,902
That's one thing.

1380
01:16:43,902 --> 01:16:46,397
AUDIENCE: Simplify
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1381
01:16:46,397 --> 01:16:47,395
PROFESSOR: Simplify.

1382
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:51,886
So what's a good
simplification?

1383
01:16:51,886 --> 01:16:52,884
Collapse?

1384
01:16:52,884 --> 01:16:56,127
AUDIENCE: You can put the two
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in series and

1385
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:57,375
treat them as one.

1386
01:16:57,375 --> 01:17:01,780
PROFESSOR: So you can treat this
as a series combination,

1387
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:06,025
and you can replace the series
of 1 and 3 with a?

1388
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:06,995
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1389
01:17:06,995 --> 01:17:07,480
AUDIENCE: 4..

1390
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,935
PROFESSOR: 4.

1391
01:17:08,935 --> 01:17:12,330
So this can be replaced by
four [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1392
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:12,815
resistor.

1393
01:17:12,815 --> 01:17:13,300
Now what?

1394
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,725
AUDIENCE: You can do the same
on the parallel one.

1395
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:18,343
PROFESSOR: So you can replace
the parallel of the 6

1396
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:19,506
and a 12 with a?

1397
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:20,342
AUDIENCE: 4.

1398
01:17:20,342 --> 01:17:22,653
PROFESSOR: Amazing
-- with a 4.

1399
01:17:22,653 --> 01:17:25,599
So there's a 4 there and
there's a 4 there.

1400
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:26,090
And the answer is?

1401
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,072
AUDIENCE: It's half.

1402
01:17:27,072 --> 01:17:28,545
PROFESSOR: Half of whatever
it was by voltage

1403
01:17:28,545 --> 01:17:30,020
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] relationship.

1404
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,760
So you think about this
becoming that.

1405
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,120
You think about the parallel
becoming that.

1406
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,200
You get a simple divide
by 2 voltage divider.

1407
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:46,660
So the answer is 7 and 1/2,
which was the middle answer.

1408
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:51,780
And so what we did today was
basically a whirlwind tour of

1409
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,790
the theory of circuits.

1410
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:58,060
And the goal for the rest of the
week is to go to the lab

1411
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,580
and do the same sort of thing
with practical where you build

1412
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:03,440
a circuit, and try to use some
of these ideas to understand

1413
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,690
what it does.

1414
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:13,295
