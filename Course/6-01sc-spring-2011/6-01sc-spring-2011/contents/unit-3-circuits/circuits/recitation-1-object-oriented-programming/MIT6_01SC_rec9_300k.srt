00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,201

00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,310
KENDRA PUGH: Hi.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,800
Today, I'd like to talk
to you about circuits.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,290
Last time, we finished up the
LTIs, and signals, and

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,140
systems, where we learned how to
both model existing systems

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,950
and predict their long-term
behavior.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,620
But we haven't forayed into how
to actually create systems

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,600
in the physical world.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,510
We've created some amount of
systems in software and made

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,720
some brains for our robots.

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,400
But if we want to make something
in the physical

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,110
world, then we probably have to
come up with ways to model

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,770
physical systems or use
physical components.

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,440
That starts our new
model on circuits.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,060
Circuits are going to be our
first foray into designing

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,630
systems in the physical world,
also designing systems using

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,080
physical components.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,920
It's worth mentioning now that
the information that you learn

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,260
about circuits is good for more

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,020
things than even circuits.

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,770
You can use basic circuit
diagrams and properties of

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,390
circuits to model all sorts of
kinds of systems, especially

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,610
ones in the human body--

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:08,910
circulatory system, neurological
system, different

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,660
kinds of fluid flow,
that kind of thing.

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,170
In the next few videos, we'll
go over how to represent

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,150
circuits, and also cover some of
the basic methods by which

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,500
people solve circuits.

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,150
We'll also introduce an element
called an op-amp, and

30
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,020
use that element in order to
enable us to do things like

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,595
modularity and abstraction
from our circuits.

32
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:33,940

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,490
First, let's talk about
representation.

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,220

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,030
In the general sense, when you
come across a circuit diagram,

36
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,150
you're going to see--

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,530
at the very broad level--

38
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,320
a bunch of elements and a bunch
of connections between

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,670
the elements.

40
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,950
Those things will form
loops and nodes.

41
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,500
If you don't actually specify
the elements, then your

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,085
circuit diagram actually
looks a whole lot

43
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,060
like a block diagram.

44
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,590
And in fact, block diagrams and
circuit diagrams are very

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,550
closely related in part because
block diagrams are

46
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,940
used to model feedback systems,
which frequently are

47
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,520
implemented using circuits.

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,380

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,580
In this course, we're going to
be focusing on independent

50
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,840
sources and resistors as the
two major kinds of elements

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,540
that we'll use in
our circuits.

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,020
We'll also use things like
potentiometers, which are

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,910
resistors that you can
adjust, and op-amps.

54
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,240
And we'll look at op-amps
specifically in a later video.

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,440
But I have one drawn up here
just so you recognize it when

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,480
you see it written.

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,360
Note that it looks a whole lot
like the block diagram symbol

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,940
for a gain.

59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,370
And that's intentional, and
we'll cover that later.

60
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,690
But in the meantime, the other
sources that we're going to be

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,310
using are independent current,
and voltage sources.

62
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,710
We're going to use resistors
to adjust the amount of

63
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,307
voltage and current that we're
actually dealing with and then

64
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,220
sample either the current or
the voltage at a particular

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,370
point in our circuit
to get the desired

66
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,250
values that we're after.

67
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,020
On a circuit diagram, when
you're interested in the

68
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,860
voltage drop across a particular
element, you'll

69
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,170
indicate it by putting a
plus and minus sign.

70
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,810
This also indicates
the directionality

71
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,530
of the voltage drop.

72
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,000
Likewise, when you're interested
in the current

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,480
flowing through a particular
element, you'll usually see an

74
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,990
indication of it by labeling the
current i, and then maybe

75
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,660
i with some sort of subscript,
and an arrow indicating the

76
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,610
direction of current flow
through that element so that

77
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,690
you avoid making sign errors
with the person that might be

78
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,940
reading or writing
your diagram.

79
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,420

80
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,510
A quick note here.

81
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,090
This is the reason that
electrical engineers use j to

82
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,630
symbolize values in
the complex plane.

83
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,680
It's because i is used
in particular

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,960
for values of current.

85
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:05,950

86
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,630
Let's review Kirchhoff's voltage
laws and Kirchhoff's

87
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,270
current laws.

88
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,550
You've probably covered this
in 8.02, electricity and

89
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,400
magnetism, or possibly in
an AP physics class.

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,358
But we're going to go over
it really fast right now.

91
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,110

92
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,200
Kirchhoff's voltage law is that
the voltage drop around a

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,940
loop is equal to 0.

94
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,650
Or if you take the voltage drop
across a particular loop

95
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,450
in your circuit, the sum
of those voltage drop

96
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,430
is going to be 0.

97
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,530
Let's demonstrate
on this diagram.

98
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,780
Or, I'll demonstrate
on this diagram.

99
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,970

100
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,690
Say the voltage drop
across this element

101
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,960
is equal to V, right?

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,250
Doesn't matter what it is.

103
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,980
We're going to stick
with that.

104
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,440

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,400
The voltage drop across these
elements, if I were to move

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,340
around this loop, is
going to sum to 0.

107
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,890

108
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,540
Note that if I'm tracing out
my voltage drop across this

109
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,070
loop, I'm actually moving
through this voltage source in

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,320
the direction opposite of
its indicated potential.

111
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,700
So when I move through this
voltage source, I'm going to

112
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,630
account for its value as
negative V. As I work my way

113
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,440
around the rest of the circuit,
the voltage drop

114
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,930
across these elements is
going to sum to V.

115
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,640
This is true for all loops
in my circuit.

116
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:59,890
So any loop that includes V, the
elements I encounter as a

117
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:09,130
consequence of moving around
that loop are going to have

118
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,330
voltage drop equal and opposite
to the value I get by

119
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,580
moving through V in
this direction.

120
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:21,300

121
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,870
This loop counts, too, but it
doesn't include V. All this

122
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,790
loop tells me is that the
voltage drop across this

123
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,110
element is equivalent
to the voltage

124
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,880
drop across this element.

125
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,380
Or, the voltage drop in this
direction across that element

126
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,110
is equal to the voltage
drop in this

127
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,810
direction across this element.

128
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,120

129
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,380
That's Kirchhoff's
voltage law.

130
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,700
Kirchhoff's current law is that
the current flow into a

131
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,830
particular node is equal to 0.

132
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,360
Or, if you take all of the
current flows in and out of a

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,150
particular node and sum them,
they should sum to 0.

134
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,930

135
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,790
I've actually got the
same set up here.

136
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,700
I'm not going to use
a current divider.

137
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:18,870

138
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,510
I'm interested in the current
flowing over this element.

139
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,400
It's actually the same as the
current flowing over this

140
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,210
element because resistance
doesn't change current,

141
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,740
resistors flowing through
a resistor should

142
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,990
not change the current.

143
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,330

144
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,220
So this is still the same i.

145
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,470
Here's my node.

146
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,660

147
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,730
The current flowing in this
direction and in this

148
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,520
direction, if I took the linear
combination of these

149
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,030
two currents, they would be
equal in value to the current

150
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,280
flowing into this node.

151
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:09,250

152
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,640
When I'm looking at the current
flowing through a

153
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,610
particular node, I
pick a direction.

154
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,730
It's usually arbitrary.

155
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,450
I pick a direction.

156
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,580
It's arbitrary which
direction I pick.

157
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,200
Typically, you pick currents
flowing into the

158
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,450
node as being positive.

159
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,130

160
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,960
I sum up all the currents, and
I set that equal to 0.

161
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,210
So in this case--.

162
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:43,059

163
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,309
Or--

164
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:51,950

165
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,200
pretty simple.

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,670

167
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,390
Let's practice on this
particular circuit.

168
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,800

169
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,640
One thing to note is that when
you're solving circuits in the

170
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,600
general sense, both when you
want TA help and when you're

171
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,620
solving for a mid-term and want
partial credit, you want

172
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,980
to label all of your nodes, all
of your elements, and all

173
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,940
of the currents that you're
interested in solving.

174
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,480
See, I've got my voltage drop
across this resistor, this

175
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,760
resistor, and this resistor
labeled, as well as these

176
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,520
currents, which I'll also
be solving for.

177
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,240

178
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,260
The first thing that I would
do when approaching this

179
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:49,680
problem is attempt to reduce
this circuit to something that

180
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,280
is a little bit simpler.

181
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,170
The first thing that I'm going
to do is try to figure out how

182
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,670
to change these two resistors
in parallel into a single

183
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,830
resistor and still have
an equivalent circuit.

184
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,230
That'll allow me to
solve for I1.

185
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,700
There will be 0 nodes
in my system.

186
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,570
I'll just have one
single loop.

187
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:21,050
And the current through the
system will just be V/R.

188
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,550
So if I'm just looking at these
two resistors, I have

189
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,800
resistors in parallel.

190
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,260

191
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,230
In the general sense, the way
to solve for resistors in

192
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:39,330
parallel is to take
the inverse of the

193
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,580
sum of their inverses.

194
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:48,750

195
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,140
When you only have two
resistors, you can typically

196
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:58,900
cheat by saying that this
is equal to their

197
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,960
product over their sum.

198
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,270

199
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,620
I'm going to redraw my current
understanding of the circuit.

200
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:43,700

201
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:50,410
The other stuff that I've saved
myself is that because

202
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,680
these resistors are
in parallel,

203
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,280
they're a current divider.

204
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,780
They take the current in and
divide it two ways determined

205
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,650
by the ratio between
these two values.

206
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,940
The thing I'm actually
interested in expressing is

207
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,740
that V2 and V3 are
the same value.

208
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,190
When you have a current divider,
the voltage drop

209
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,590
across all elements in the
current divider are the same.

210
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,590
So the value of V here is going
to be both V2 and V3.

211
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:37,800

212
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,720
2R plus 6/5 R. I'm going to
go with 16/5 R for now.

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:13:11,510

214
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:19,330
I've solved for I.

215
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,160
At this point, I have a voltage
divider, which means

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,870
that the current flowing through
this part of the

217
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,830
system is going to
be the same.

218
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:33,150
But the voltage drop across
this element versus this

219
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,830
element is going to be
proportional to the ratio

220
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,320
between these two values.

221
00:13:37,320 --> 00:14:03,530

222
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:08,770
V1 is going to be the amount
of the total resistance in

223
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:16,750
this simple circuit that this
resistor contributes over the

224
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,450
entire resistance
in the system.

225
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:28,350
Or, 10/5 R over 16/5 R, which is
10/16 R, or 5/8 R. Or, it's

226
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:52,070
going to be 5/8 V.

227
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,447
Same thing happens with V2.

228
00:14:53,447 --> 00:15:12,840

229
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,530
Note that these two values
should sum to V in order to

230
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,000
maintain Kirchoff's
voltage law.

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,710

232
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,960
We've also found V3.

233
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,900

234
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,390
So the two things that we have
to find are I2 and I3.

235
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:54,640

236
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,310
Here, I've just done
Kirchoff's current

237
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,560
law for this node.

238
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,090

239
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,800
Because I'm working with a
current divider, I can break

240
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,250
up the total current flowing
into that node into the number

241
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,110
of parts equal to the sum
of these values and then

242
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,780
distribute them.

243
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,760
And then, that's
[? inappropriate ?]

244
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,450
given that less resistance
means more current.

245
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,990
What do I mean by that?

246
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,040
Well, I mean that here my
current is equal to 5/16 V

247
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:45,580
over R. I2 is going to be equal
to this value over the

248
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,190
sum of these two values
times I1.

249
00:16:52,190 --> 00:17:03,340

250
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,590
Likewise--.

251
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:16,970

252
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,220
And just to simplify--.

253
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:36,610

254
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,700
That concludes my tutorial
on circuits.

255
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,550
Next time, we'll talk about
other ways we can solve this

256
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,650
circuit, and then we'll end
up talking about op-amps.

257
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,900
