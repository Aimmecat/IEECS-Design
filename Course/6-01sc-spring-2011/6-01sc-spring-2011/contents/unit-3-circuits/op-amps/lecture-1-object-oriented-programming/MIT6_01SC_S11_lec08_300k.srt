00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,660

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,000
PROFESSOR: Hello.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,980
Welcome.

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,690
Welcome back from
spring break.

13
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,120
Today what I want to do
is talk about op-amps.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,070
And in particular what I want to
do is talk about modularity

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,030
in circuit design.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,510
How do you make circuits
that are modular?

17
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,640
We'll see that there's special
problems when you think about

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,060
modularity applied
to circuits.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,840
And op-amps are one solution
for helping us think about

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,550
those problems.

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,890
Before launching straight into
something new though, I'd like

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,340
to recap where we are under the
assumption that you may

23
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,310
not have been thinking about
this exactly currently.

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,290
So last time we took our
first look at circuits.

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,280
Circuits are very different from
the kinds of things we've

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
thought about before.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,880
Before, in programming, in
linear systems theory, we

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,380
thought about blocks that had
well-defined inputs and

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,320
well-defined outputs.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,310
Circuits are different.

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,510
Circuits are all connected
together.

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,530
And circuit theory is thinking
about how do you organize your

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,560
thoughts about complicated
interactions among things.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,630
The parts interact because they
touch each other and they

35
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,810
share voltages.

36
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,830
Because they touch each other,
they share currents.

37
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,950
And you have to somehow
think about that

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,520
whole complicated system.

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,890

40
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,930
We figured out that the way you
think about that, you can

41
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,140
think about it as three
separate enterprises.

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,290
How do you think
about voltages.

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,260
How do you think
about currents.

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,360
And how do you think
about the elements.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,530
How do you think
about voltages?

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,610
Well, the sum of the
voltages around any

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,120
closed loop is zero.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,070
Done.

49
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,720
KVL --

50
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,290
Kirchoff's Voltage Law.

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,520
How do you think
about currents?

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,900
Draw any surface.

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,670
The net current that leaves
the surface is zero.

54
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,350
KCL --

55
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,460
Kirchoff's Current Law.

56
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,430
How do you think about
the elements?

57
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,130
Well it depends on
the element.

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,700
If you're thinking about a
linear resistor, it's Ohm's

59
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,440
Law, V equals IR.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
If you're thinking about a
source, it could be a voltage

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
source, then V equals v0,
some fixed number.

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,850
If you're thinking about a
current source, then current

63
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,840
is fixed at some fixed number.

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,390
So it depends.

65
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,840
When you're thinking about the
element laws, it depends on

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,720
what element you are
thinking about.

67
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,820
And then you just combine all
of those, and you can solve

68
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,150
the circuit.

69
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,320
The only problem that arises
is that those equations are

70
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,750
highly redundant.

71
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,200
There's a lot more KVL equations
than you need.

72
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,770
There's a lot more KCL equations
than you need.

73
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,430
And so in fact, the trick in
analyzing a circuit is to

74
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,650
figure out the smallest number
of equations that are

75
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,960
adequate, the number of
equations that are necessary

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,860
and sufficient to
find a solution.

77
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,440
Last time we went through three

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,000
different ways to do that.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,690
We thought about what I will
think of as primitive or

80
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,390
element voltages and currents.

81
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,450
The idea in that technique is
you think about every element

82
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,710
and assign to that element
its voltage and its

83
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,960
corresponding current.

84
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,780

85
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,590
Then that gives you, as in this
example if you've got six

86
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,020
elements, that gives you six
unknowns, one voltage across

87
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,290
every element, one current
through every element.

88
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,820
So then you've got to dig up
six other relationships.

89
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,440
Sorry, start again.

90
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,650
Six elements, six voltages, six
currents, 12 unknowns, you

91
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,065
need to come up with
12 equations.

92
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:16,579

93
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,790
Six of them are element
equations.

94
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,560
So six are easy.

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,170
Then you have to come
up with six more.

96
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,150
And for this particular circuit,
it turns out that

97
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,920
there is three independent

98
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,100
Kirchoff's Voltage Law equations.

99
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,560
And there are three independent
KCL, Kirchoff's

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,270
Current Law equations.

101
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,080
12 equations, 12 unknowns
to solve, done.

102
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,640

103
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,480
That's actually more work
than you need to do.

104
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,020
So we looked at two other
techniques for solving the

105
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,700
same kind of circuits.

106
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,265
One's called node voltages
and another

107
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:53,970
is called loop currents.

108
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,760
They are duals of each other.

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,560
In the node voltage method you
figure out exactly the minimum

110
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
number of voltages that I would
have to tell you in

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,120
order to specify all of
the element voltages.

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,790
So for example, if I told you
this voltage here, and that

113
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,660
voltage there, and this voltage
there, and that

114
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,480
voltage there, four of them,
that would let you calculate

115
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,510
all of the element voltages.

116
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,920
But now I only have four
instead of six.

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,280
Four nodes instead of six
element voltages.

118
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,750
So it's smaller.

119
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,720
And we talked about last time
how you could find the correct

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,390
equations that go with
those node voltages.

121
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,870
In the loop current method, you
specify the minimum number

122
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,020
of currents that would be
sufficient to account for all

123
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,920
of the element currents.

124
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,970
And here in this circuit
it required three.

125
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,600
Three is smaller than six.

126
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,010
There were six element
currents.

127
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,240
So again we've got a reduction
in the number of unknowns --

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,965
12 4, 3.

129
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,960

130
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,150
So that's kind of the idea.

131
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,780
And just to make sure that
you're all with it, think

132
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,720
about this problem.

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,700
How many of the following
expressions are correct?

134
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,150
Feel free to talk to
your neighbor.

135
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,930
At the end of about 45 seconds,
I'll ask you to raise

136
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,020
your hand with a number of
fingers, (1) through (5) --

137
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,640
indicating which is the
correct answer.

138
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:48,290

139
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,820
Dead silence.

140
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,070
You're allowed to talk.

141
00:06:51,070 --> 00:08:39,390

142
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,100
OK, so how many of the
relations are true?

143
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,340
Everybody raise your hand.

144
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,740
Indicate a number fingers that
tells me how many of the

145
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,020
answers are correct.

146
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,930

147
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,900
Come on.

148
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,790
Blame it on your neighbor.

149
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,330
You can say anything, right?

150
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,660
It's always your neighbor's
fault.

151
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,200
That's very good.

152
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,950
It's about 95% correct,
almost all correct.

153
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,260
This first equation,
what is this?

154
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,780
Give that a name.

155
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,840
KVL.

156
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,020
Is it correct?

157
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,580
Sure.

158
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,010
You need to figure out which
path it corresponds to.

159
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,180
It goes through--

160
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,640
The only v's are over here.

161
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,860
So therefore it must be
something that has to do with

162
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,170
this circuit.

163
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,850
So this says that there's
1, 2, 6, and 5.

164
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,140
That's path 1, 2, 6, and 5.

165
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,835
So all you really need to do
is check the polarities.

166
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,700

167
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,720
So if we took all of the
variables to the same side,

168
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,100
then we'd have minus v1 plus
v2 plus v6 plus v5.

169
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,180
If we think about going a loop
that goes through the minus

170
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,140
v1, that would be this way.

171
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,170
Plus v2 plus v6 plus v5.

172
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,770
So that's right.

173
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,720
Easy.

174
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,180
What's the point of
this equation?

175
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,630
v6 equals e1 minus e2,
what's that say?

176
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,860
Why'd I ask that?

177
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,300
Yeah.

178
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,550
AUDIENCE: It's saying
that the--

179
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,692

180
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,340
PROFESSOR: Exactly, it's
intended to make you think

181
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,510
through the relationship
between the primitive

182
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,920
variables, the element
voltages,

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,520
and the node voltages.

184
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,660
If I told you the node voltages
e1 and e2, you could

185
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,570
trivially compute v6.

186
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,540
You could also compute
any of the other v's.

187
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,250
If I told you to find v--

188
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,650
what is that?

189
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,650
My eyes are not very good.

190
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,800
v4, if I told you to find v4,
that would be e1 minus ground.

191
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,850
We assign the number 0 to
ground, so that would be e1.

192
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,030
So the idea, the reason I ask
number (2), is to make you

193
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,750
think about how you relate
the node voltages

194
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,280
to the element voltages.

195
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,620
How about number (3),
what's that?

196
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,030

197
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:56,600
Well it's highly related
to number (2).

198
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,660
But it's different from
number (2), because?

199
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,600
AUDIENCE: Ohm's Law?

200
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,080
PROFESSOR: Ohm's Law.

201
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,820
So equation (3) is the way Ohm's
Law looks when you use

202
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,070
node equations.

203
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,970

204
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,980
Ohm's Law is a little bit
uglier when you use node

205
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,930
equations than when you use
primitive variables.

206
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,090
When you use primitive
variables, the same

207
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:23,970
relationship would've simply
said that v6 is R6 times i6.

208
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,550

209
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,970
Because I'm using node voltages
instead, the voltage

210
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,400
across resistor six shows
up as a difference.

211
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,220
How about this one?

212
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,470
What's that?

213
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,980

214
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,726
True or false, this is KCL?

215
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:48,702
AUDIENCE: False.

216
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:49,678
AUDIENCE: False.

217
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:52,606
AUDIENCE: --KCL.

218
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:53,582
PROFESSOR: True.

219
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,510
This is KCL, true.

220
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,990
OK.

221
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,005
This is KCL, false.

222
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,280
Well, obviously we're
numerous.

223
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,900
And it's not, sort of, 100%
participation, but--

224
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,830
This is not KCL.

225
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,920
What is that?

226
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,170
KCL says that the sum
of current out

227
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,710
of some closed path.

228
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,410
This is mixed thing.

229
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,210
i6 is one of these things.

230
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,520
And IB and IC is one
of these things.

231
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,210
So what is the equation for?

232
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,406

233
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:27,850
AUDIENCE: Incorrect.

234
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,350
PROFESSOR: Incorrect, yes.

235
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,428
What would be the correct way
of saying equation (4)?

236
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:34,678
AUDIENCE: i6 equals--

237
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:38,308

238
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,772
i6 is--

239
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:41,724
PROFESSOR: The answer to set
questions according to the

240
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:45,671
theory of lectures is go
to the next slide.

241
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:47,042
Here's the correct expression.

242
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,710
Why is this correct, and why
is that not correct?

243
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:55,310

244
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,796
Equation (4) is intended to be
how do you relate the loop

245
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:01,885
current to the element
currents?

246
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:06,330

247
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,560
So i6 is an element current.

248
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,900
It's the current that
goes through R6.

249
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,750
When we do loop currents, we
have two currents going

250
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,000
through R6.

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,580

252
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,190
So in the loop current view,
the total current that goes

253
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,940
through R6 is a sum or
difference of the two loop

254
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,500
currents that go through R6.

255
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,950
So the element current through
R6, which is i6, is a sum or

256
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,520
difference of loop currents.

257
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,340
There are two loop currents
we have to worry about.

258
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,700
Which one goes through in
the correct direction?

259
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,530
i6 goes from left to right.

260
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,960
So when we do the loop currents,
we need to take

261
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,650
positive as the direction
from left to right.

262
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,150
Well that's the direction of
IC and is the opposite

263
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,300
direction of IB.

264
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,220
So if I want to use loop
currents to specify i6, it

265
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,960
would be IC minus IB.

266
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,220
Everybody clear on that?

267
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,970
So equation (4) is the relation
between element

268
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,170
currents and loop currents.

269
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,420
So what's equation (5)?

270
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,270

271
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,830
Equation (5) is Ohm's Law
for loop currents.

272
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,060

273
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,750
Again, if I were thinking about
Ohm's Law for R6, I

274
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,020
would have v6 equals i6 R6.

275
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,340
That's the way you say it in
element voltages and currents.

276
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,590
Over here, the current through
R6 is IC minus IB.

277
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,940
So Ohm's Law looks a little
bit more complicated.

278
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,530
So the point is these three
methods represent ways of

279
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:56,310
figuring out a linearly
independent set of unknowns

280
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,110
and equations.

281
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,960
They differ.

282
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,870
The left hand one is probably
the easiest to think about,

283
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,110
especially when you're
thinking about

284
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,770
things like Ohm's Law.

285
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,520
It's the natural way to
specify the element

286
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,020
relationships.

287
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,920
It's the relation between
the voltage and current

288
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,180
through that part.

289
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,350
That generally gives me
a large number of

290
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,600
equations and unknowns.

291
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,160

292
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,550
You can reduce the number of
unknowns by using something

293
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,710
like node voltages
or loop currents.

294
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,980
And that gives you fewer
equations to solve.

295
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,010
They are completely
equivalent.

296
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,170
They look a little different.

297
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,490
And the reason for talking about
them is that when we

298
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,220
think about writing a program
to solve circuits

299
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,350
automatically, which by the way
will be the exercise in

300
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,670
software lab this week.

301
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,460

302
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,970
When we think about writing a
program, writing a program is

303
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,620
yet a different kind
of challenge.

304
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,040
What's the easiest system
to automate?

305
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,040
So the system that is easiest
for you may or may not be the

306
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,750
easiest system to automate.

307
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,580
So that's the point of this
week's software lab.

308
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,120
We'll do a method that's closely
related to the node

309
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,320
voltage method.

310
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,590
It's not quite node voltages.

311
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,340
It's a little simpler than node
voltages for a computer.

312
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,300
It's a little simpler
to automate.

313
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,410
So we use a method that's called
node voltages with

314
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,660
component currents.

315
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,250

316
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,680
OK, now I'm going to
start new stuff.

317
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,930
That was review.

318
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,440

319
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,450
What I want to think about
today is what is it about

320
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,080
circuit design that
makes it hard.

321
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,040
What are the issues that make
it difficult to be modular

322
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,870
when we're thinking
about the analysis

323
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,540
and design of circuits.

324
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,720
And one of the hardest things to
deal with is the idea that

325
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,819
in a circuit, unlike in a linear
time invariant system

326
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,680
of the type we talked about in
the previous module, in a

327
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,420
circuit the presence of every
element affects the currents

328
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,780
and voltages through, in

329
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,450
principle, every other element.

330
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:25,280
So if you change one thing,
you change everything.

331
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,700
So first off, I want to just
give an example of that.

332
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,190
Think about what would happen
if I were trying to make a

333
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,540
circuit to control the
brightness of a light bulb.

334
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,130
So I imagine that I've
got this circuit

335
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,490
and I close the switch.

336
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,560
Closing the switch is

337
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,280
equivalent to adding a component.

338
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,910
So before I close the switch,
when the switch was open, I

339
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,760
have three elements, a voltage
source and two resistors.

340
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,520
After I close the switch, I
have four elements, the

341
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,380
original three plus the bulb.

342
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,480
So the question is how would
closing the switch

343
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,730
affect V0 and I0.

344
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,290

345
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,970
Take a minute.

346
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,870
Talk to your neighbor.

347
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,655
Figure out how V0
and I0 change.

348
00:18:10,655 --> 00:20:24,040

349
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,600
So what's the answer?

350
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,920
Everybody raise your hand, show
a number of fingers equal

351
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,420
to the answer.

352
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,060
That's very good.

353
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,540
It's 95% correct at
least, maybe 100.

354
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,070
OK, so the answer is (2).

355
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,690
Why is the answer (2)?

356
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,775
How do I figure that out?

357
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:43,170
AUDIENCE: So the total
resistance of the circuit is

358
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,570
going to decrease because you're
adding it in parallel.

359
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:53,790
And then V0 is going to decrease
because it's going to

360
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,225
have a lower equivalent
resistance.

361
00:20:56,225 --> 00:21:00,610
And because that decreases,
you have I0 to--

362
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,600
PROFESSOR: Yes, I think that's
exactly correct.

363
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,970
So the idea was that when
you add a component--

364
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,020
Let's think about the light
bulb being a resistor.

365
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,660
That's kind of pulled out of
thin air, but I sort of

366
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,120
suggested that you might
do that here.

367
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,810
Think about representing the
light bulb as a resistor.

368
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,205
Then when you close the switch,
these two resistors go

369
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:22,720
in parallel.

370
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,490
When you combine two things in
parallel, the result is the

371
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,520
same as a resistance that
has a smaller value.

372
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,060
And then think about how that
smaller value would interact

373
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,600
with this resistor
and that source.

374
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,570
And you can sort of figure out
that the presence of this bulb

375
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,780
would reduce this voltage and
increase that current.

376
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:51,880
That's kind of a high level of
reasoning given where we are.

377
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,780
If you wanted to think through
this a little more step by

378
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,150
step, it's easy.

379
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,940
You could think about figuring
out what are the voltages and

380
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,145
currents before and after
you close the switch.

381
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:06,320

382
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,830
Before you close the switch, you
can just ignore this, and

383
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,480
you can calculate V0 just
from a voltage divider

384
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,440
relationship.

385
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,060
Right, that's clear?

386
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,890
So you can see that when the
switch is open, the voltage,

387
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,155
V0, is going to be 8 Volts.

388
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:25,600

389
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,550
And when the switch is open,
you can figure out I0 by

390
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,370
lumping these two resistors
together to

391
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,690
make a 3 Ohm resistor.

392
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,250
And you see that I0 is 4 Amps.

393
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,360

394
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,230
Then to figure out what happens
when you close the

395
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,480
switch, just repeat.

396
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,730

397
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,140
And the algebra is a little
more tedious.

398
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,130
I won't try to go through it.

399
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,800
By the way, the answers, the
slides that I show in lecture

400
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,430
are always posted on the web.

401
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,300
So these slides that have the
answers, they are there.

402
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,820
On the web there are two
handouts per lecture.

403
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,290
There's an electronic
version of the thing

404
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,170
that we handed out.

405
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,240
There's also an electronic
version of my slides.

406
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,880
So everything that I
showed is there.

407
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,580
I'm not going to go through
the tedious algebra.

408
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,820
It's just tedious algebra.

409
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,630
But if you go through the
tedious algebra, you find that

410
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,240
if you represent this bulb by
resistor R, V0 becomes an

411
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,555
expression that looks
like this.

412
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:24,340

413
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,770
If you think about resistors,
physical resistors, if you

414
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,340
think about light bulbs being
represented by a physical

415
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,470
resistor, then the physical
resistor has to have a

416
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,340
resistance between
0 and infinity.

417
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,730
And if you think about that
expression, what could the

418
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,020
value be if R varied between
0 and infinity?

419
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,460
That expression is always less
than or equal to 8 Volts,

420
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,350
showing that V0 went down when
you closed the switch.

421
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,620
Similar tedious algebra leads to
an expression like this in

422
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,640
R. And if you think about how
this would change as R goes

423
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,930
from 0 to infinity, you
see that that's always

424
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,180
bigger than 4 Amps.

425
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,260

426
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,020
So that means I0 goes up.

427
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,480
So the point is you can think
through this in a more

428
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,580
sophisticated way.

429
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,580
And we hope by the end of
the course you'll all

430
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,840
be able to do that.

431
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,140
Or you can think through
it in terms of

432
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,450
just solving the circuit.

433
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,516
Solve it in two cases when the
bulb is there and when the

434
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,690
bulb is not.

435
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,710
Either way, the answer is (2).

436
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,430
The V0 went down,
and I0 went up.

437
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:31,050
The point is that when I added
the element, currents that

438
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,150
were far away from the element
still changed.

439
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,460
And that's a general way
circuits interact.

440
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,530
They're all connected.

441
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,180
So the idea, the point of
doing this is that the

442
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,460
addition of a new element
changed the voltages and

443
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,320
currents through the
other element.

444
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,290
That's a drag if what I was
trying to do, for example, was

445
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:58,720
design a brightness controller
for the flashlight bulb.

446
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,680
Imagine that what I really
wanted to do was use a voltage

447
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,180
divider to make 8 Volts.

448
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,160
And what was in my head was I'd
like that 8 Volts to be

449
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,170
across the light bulb.

450
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,160
That's a good idea.

451
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,940
It just won't work.

452
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,410
At least It won't work the
way this circuit worked.

453
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,600
If I just build it like so,
there's an interaction between

454
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,080
the bulb and the voltage divider
circuits, so the

455
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,760
voltage divider circuit is no
longer a voltage divider.

456
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,610
After, in this circuit, when
I close the switch, current

457
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,870
flows in this wire.

458
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,650
The rule in a voltage divider
is the same current has to

459
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,050
flow through both resistors.

460
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,350
If the same current flows
through two resistors, then

461
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,380
you can use the voltage divider
relationship to see

462
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,260
how voltage partitions between
the two resistors.

463
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,950
If current gets siphoned off
the node between the two

464
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,370
resistors, you can't
use the voltage

465
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,020
divider relation anymore.

466
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:56,720
That violates the premise of the
voltage divider relation.

467
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,350
So when I close the switch, this
is no longer a voltage

468
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,840
divider, and it no longer works
like a voltage divider.

469
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,860
Is that clear?

470
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,980
So what I'd really like is some
magic circuit that I can

471
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,200
put here that isolates the
effect of the bulb on the

472
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,790
effect of the rest
of the circuit.

473
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,080
And that's exactly what
an op-amp does.

474
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,850
That's what we're going
to talk about next.

475
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,370
So this magic circuit
is something that

476
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,750
we'll call a buffer.

477
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,300
A buffer is a thing
that isolates the

478
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,360
left from the right.

479
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,200
So the buffer is going to be
something that measures the

480
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,240
voltage on this side and
magically generates that

481
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,200
voltage over here without
changing this side.

482
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,490
So what we want to do now is
develop some thought tools for

483
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,600
how you think about op-amps.

484
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,910
Op-amps are different.

485
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,120
And if you just look at the
picture, op-amp has to be

486
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,410
different because there's
too many terminals.

487
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,290

488
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,170
It's not like a resistor
that has two legs.

489
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,890
It's not like a V source
which has two legs.

490
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,590
It's not like an I source
which has two legs.

491
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,890
It has three legs.

492
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,230
In fact, I haven't drawn
all the legs.

493
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,670
There's more than three.

494
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,750
There's at least five.

495
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,570
So they're different.

496
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,490
And the way we think about
them are different.

497
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,520
The key to thinking about the
way an op-amp works is to

498
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,390
think about a new class
of elements

499
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,830
called controlled elements.

500
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,340
So a controlled element is an
element whose voltage current

501
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,380
relationship depends somehow
on a voltage and current

502
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,140
measured someplace else
in the circuit.

503
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,470
As an example, think
about a current

504
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,280
controlled current source.

505
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,210
That's depicted here.

506
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,330
I would normally
write a current

507
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,510
source that was a circle.

508
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,140
That means it's an independent
current source.

509
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,030
That means that the
current is fixed.

510
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,680
The little diamond thing is my
way of representing the idea

511
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,980
that the amount of current that
comes out of this current

512
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,360
source depends on
something else.

513
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,970
In this case it depends on IB.

514
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,060
And IB happens to be a current
that flows in that circuit.

515
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,420
So the idea is that the current
in the current source

516
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,320
depends on some other current.

517
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,360
It's a current controlled
current source.

518
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,010
It's a current source whose
current is controlled by

519
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,271
another current.

520
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:19,521
Got it?

521
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:21,960

522
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,070
So we'll see.

523
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,240
Figure out, for this current
controlled current source

524
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,200
circuit, what's the ratio
of Vout over Vin?

525
00:28:31,200 --> 00:30:40,490

526
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,680
So what's the answer?

527
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,223
What's the ratio of
Vout over Vin?

528
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:48,646

529
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,125
100%, wonderful.

530
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,590
The answer is (4).

531
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,562
Easy to get.

532
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,560
It's easy to get because
I rigged this

533
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,730
question to be easy.

534
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,370
I rigged it to be easy because
you can sort of figure out

535
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,760
everything that's going
on on the left.

536
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,050
And then you can figure
out everything that's

537
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,860
going on on the right.

538
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
And so there's no sort
of complicated

539
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,670
coupling between the two.

540
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,350
So what's going on on
the left, well, you

541
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,160
can solve for IB.

542
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,110
IB is just Vi over 1,000 Ohms.

543
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,090
Then you can take that value
of IB and use that to solve

544
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,700
for what's going on over here.

545
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,380
Over here the out is this
current, 100 IB times this

546
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,910
resistance, 5 Ohms.

547
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,790
But we just found out that
IB is VI over 1,000 Ohms.

548
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,120
Substitute it in,
you get half Vi.

549
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,290
So the answer is number (4).

550
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,450
The ratio of Vout to
Vin is a half.

551
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,280
So the point is these are a
different kind of element,

552
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,520
controlled sources,
dependent sources.

553
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,790
But they're not too
hard to work with.

554
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,350
They sort of look different
structurally.

555
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,370
So think about what's
going on here.

556
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,040
The controlled current source,
the current controlled current

557
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,130
source, I have to think of that
as a box, because the

558
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,250
current source has to know
the value of IB.

559
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,770
So somehow this box, this
thing that's doing this

560
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:20,180
current controlled current
source, it knows about IB, and

561
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,830
it knows about the
current source.

562
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,020
So they're somehow linked.

563
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,060
So that's why I put
a box around it.

564
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,530
And then think about the
equations that characterize

565
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,420
that component.

566
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,340
So now we've got a component
that's got four wires

567
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,690
coming out of it.

568
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,000
The components we had before
had two wires coming out of

569
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,590
them, resistors, current
sources, voltage sources.

570
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,440
This kind of a component has
four wires coming out of them.

571
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,040
We call this kind of a component
a two-port because

572
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,110
we think of the left port
and the right port.

573
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,535
That's compared to resistor,
which we

574
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:56,785
would call a one-port.

575
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:59,570

576
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,870
We think about this
being a two-port.

577
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,060
And there's now two equations.

578
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,400
Now I've got, for that two-port,
I've got two

579
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,550
voltages and two currents.

580
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,280
There's the voltage across
the left part.

581
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,840
And there's the voltage
across the right part.

582
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,790
And there's current through
the left part.

583
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,890
And there's the current through
the right part.

584
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,960
So with the elements we've
thought about before, I had

585
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,390
one voltage across it and
one current through it.

586
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,990
Now I've got two voltages across
it and two currents.

587
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,050
It's kind of twice as big.

588
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,300
Not surprisingly, it takes
twice as many equations.

589
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,890

590
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,700
Ohm's Law was a single
equation for

591
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,130
one resistor, a one-port.

592
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,440
V equals V0 was one
equation for one

593
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,600
component, a voltage source.

594
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,320
Here, I've got one component
that has

595
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,590
four wires, four unknowns.

596
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,170
And I get two equations.

597
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,420
So for this particular dependent
source, I know that

598
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,340
the voltage across this pair
of terminals is 0, because

599
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,385
it's essentially a short circuit
between the two.

600
00:34:02,385 --> 00:34:05,240

601
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,429
Short circuit just means
connected with a wire.

602
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:13,780
And I know that the current I2
is related to the current over

603
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,380
there this way.

604
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,250
The idea then is that this
current controlled current

605
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,130
source can be represented by a
two-port, two voltages, two

606
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:28,320
currents related by
two equations.

607
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,860
It's kind of structurally twice
as difficult to think

608
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,290
about as a one-port.

609
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,230
Functionally, it's different
from having two one-ports,

610
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,030
because the two one-ports
are coupled.

611
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,350
And that's the important part
is the coupling between the

612
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,980
two that you can't model with a
simple resistor and a simple

613
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,449
constant source.

614
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,570
So when we think about an
op-amp, a good first model for

615
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,130
an op-amp is to think about
it as a voltage controlled

616
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,380
voltage source.

617
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,670

618
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,940
And so that's depicted here.

619
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,550
I want to think about the
op-amp, which I'll

620
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,000
symbolically write this way.

621
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,840
This means something that has
two inputs, a plus input and

622
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,220
then a minus input, and
a single output, Vout.

623
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,670
I can think about
it as a voltage

624
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,460
controlled voltage source.

625
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,380
This I mean to be the element
representation.

626
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,380
This is how I'll draw it
when I make a schematic

627
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,530
diagram of a circuit.

628
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,140
This is the functional form.

629
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,370
This is the way I'll
think about it when

630
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,250
I'm analyzing it.

631
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,750
I'll think about the op-amp as
being a voltage controlled

632
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,100
voltage source.

633
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,130
This voltage source adopts a
voltage that is some number K

634
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,220
times the difference voltage
Vplus minus Vminus.

635
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,870

636
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,920
And the trick in op-amps is that
K is typically a very big

637
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,120
number, typically bigger
than 10 to the 5th.

638
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,970
We'll see in a minute
why that's a

639
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:02,480
frightfully useful component.

640
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,950
Let's just walk through an
example to see how you would

641
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,180
solve a circuit that has this
kind of a voltage controlled

642
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,680
voltage source in it.

643
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,850
So think about this circuit
where I'm applying a voltage

644
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:19,440
to the plus lead of an op-amp,
and I'm wrapping the output

645
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,850
back through the minus lead,
through two resistors.

646
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,920
And what I want to do is
analyze that circuit by

647
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,600
thinking about the op-amp
as a voltage

648
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,045
controlled voltage source.

649
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:34,300

650
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,580
So I can see just by the way
it's wired up that the voltage

651
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,670
at the plus lead--

652
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,170
So I'm going to be thinking
node voltages.

653
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,720

654
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,630
Node voltages tend to be easy.

655
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,070
I'm thinking node voltages.

656
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,690
So I'm going to define
all my voltages

657
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,940
referenced to a ground.

658
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,550

659
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,520
So I'll call this node ground.

660
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,120
That's what the funny
symbol means.

661
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,790
Then this node voltage, the
voltage at the plus terminal,

662
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,340
is just the same as
the input voltage.

663
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,890

664
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,950
This voltage at the minus
terminal looks like a voltage

665
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,000
divider relationship.

666
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,790
If you look at my model, it's
very clear that I1 is 0,

667
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,290
because there's no connection
here between the

668
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,980
Vplus and the Vminus.

669
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,160
So I1 is 0.

670
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,620
That means the total current
that flows into the plus lead

671
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,870
of the op-amp is 0.

672
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,660
The total current that flows
into the minus lead of the

673
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,130
op-amp is 0.

674
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,290
So because there's no current
flowing in the plus and minus

675
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:40,560
leads, I can calculate the
voltage at this minus terminal

676
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,440
as a voltage divider.

677
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,427
And it's just R1 over the sum
of R1 and R2 times V0.

678
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:52,500

679
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,250
Then according to the voltage
control voltage source model,

680
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,240
Vout should be K times
the difference

681
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,960
between Vplus and Vminus.

682
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,830

683
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:09,420
So I just substitute in for
Vplus -- this guy, Vi, and for

684
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,450
Vminus -- this guy.

685
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,700
Do some algebra.

686
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,730

687
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,510
I get this expression
after some algebra.

688
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:22,450
And then I say, yeah but I
know that K's really big.

689
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:28,800
So if K's really big, KR1
is big compared to R1.

690
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,000
So I can ignore that.

691
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,450
In fact, K is so big that for
any reasonable choice of R1

692
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,770
and R2, KR1 is even
bigger than R2.

693
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,030
So that means this reduces to
this kind of a fraction.

694
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,030
So the response of this circuit,
this op-amp circuit--

695
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,640
So what did I do?

696
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,080
I just took the op-amp circuit,
and I modelled it as

697
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,160
a voltage controlled voltage
source, plugged through the

698
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,210
equations, and found out that
the ratio of the output

699
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,190
voltage to the input voltage
is R1 over R1 plus

700
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,440
R2 divided by R1.

701
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,330

702
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,150
So the idea then is that
this simple circuit

703
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,830
works like an amplifier.

704
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,740
It's an amplifier in the sense
that I can make the output

705
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,480
voltage bigger than
the input voltage.

706
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,690
That's a very useful thing.

707
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,430
In fact you'll find useful ways
to use that when you do

708
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,790
the design lab this week.

709
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,040

710
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,030
So this as an amplifier.

711
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,820
So here's a question.

712
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,490
Make sure you follow
what I just did.

713
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,420
How could I choose the
components R1 and R2 so that I

714
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,827
make Vout equal to Vi?

715
00:39:36,827 --> 00:40:58,832

716
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:01,870
AUDIENCE: Why is this 0?

717
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,120
PROFESSOR: There's no
wire connecting.

718
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,565

719
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:06,010
AUDIENCE: Oh.

720
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,210
PROFESSOR: So there's nowhere
for current to go.

721
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:23,910

722
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,340
OK so how would I choose the
components R1 and R2 in order

723
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,200
to make the output voltage equal
to the input voltage?

724
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,750

725
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,970
Wonderful.

726
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,290
So the idea is that all of these
manipulations have the

727
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,200
same effect.

728
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,520
All you need to do
is look at the

729
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
expression that we developed.

730
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,680
The expression was R1
plus R2 over R1.

731
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,130
If you substitute, R1 goes to
infinity, R2 equals 0, or the

732
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:59,240
two at the same time, you get
one in all of those cases.

733
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,120
So that's a way that you can
turn this amplifier circuit,

734
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,960
that in general would make the
output bigger than the input,

735
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,650
into something that makes the
output equal to the input.

736
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,260

737
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,100
Now I want to turn to
a simplification.

738
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,840
I just dragged you
through the math.

739
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,400
Thinking about the op-amp as a
voltage controlled voltage

740
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,360
source, there's actually
a shortcut.

741
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,230
The shortcut is something we
call the ideal op-amp.

742
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,600
So what I want to do in this
slide is drag you through the

743
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,060
math one more time, but
then we're done.

744
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:43,150
The idea is that if you have
an op-amp, a voltage

745
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,510
controlled voltage source, if
you represent an op-amp as a

746
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,090
voltage controlled voltage
source, and if K is very big,

747
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:54,540
the effect will be to make the
difference between the

748
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,290
positive and negative
terminals of the

749
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,260
op-amp quite small.

750
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,890
You can see that here by way
of a simple example.

751
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:08,180
So let me think about this case
with, again, the voltage

752
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,480
controlled voltage
source model.

753
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,430
So here I've got Vout.

754
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,320
According to the voltage
controlled voltage source

755
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,730
model, Vout should be K
times the difference

756
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,980
between the two inputs.

757
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,770

758
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,170
The positive input
is clearly Vi.

759
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,440
The negative input is Vo.

760
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,710
One equation, two unknowns,
solve for the ratio.

761
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,190
The ratio of Vout to Vi
is K over (1 plus K).

762
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,420

763
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,680
That's the answer.

764
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,540
Take that answer and back
substitute to figure out how

765
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,910
big was the difference between
Vplus and Vminus.

766
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,810

767
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,970
That's just algebra.

768
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,660
And what you see is that if this
is the answer, then Vplus

769
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,410
minus Vminus can be written as
a fraction of Vi or a similar

770
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,630
fraction of Vo.

771
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,302
K is big.

772
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:05,780
K is essentially the
same as K plus 1.

773
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,750
K is in the denominator
of both.

774
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,350
What that says is the difference
between the plus

775
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,030
and the minus leads, the voltage
between the plus and

776
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:22,500
the minus leads, is very small
if K is very large.

777
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,230
OK?

778
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,710
So we call that the ideal
op-amp relationship.

779
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,970
The utility of that is that it
makes solving the op-amp

780
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,480
circuits much, much
easier than what

781
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,350
we've just been doing.

782
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:38,400
I've been solving the circuits
by thinking about the op-amp

783
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,640
as a voltage controlled
voltage source.

784
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,610
That's fine.

785
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,700
But if I additionally know
that K is very big, I can

786
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,430
shortcut it.

787
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,100
I can say, look, the effect of
the op-amp is going to be to

788
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,600
make the positive and negative
inputs the same.

789
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,120
If it didn't do that, think
of what it would mean.

790
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,460
If K is a big number, and if the
output voltage is K times

791
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,560
the difference, if the
difference is anything other

792
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,390
than epsilon, Vout has
to be infinity.

793
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,060
I mean if K is very
big, right?

794
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,160
If K is very big, the only way
the output could be some

795
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,530
reasonable number like a Volt
would be if the difference

796
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,150
between Vplus and Vminus
is very small.

797
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,490
OK, well let's work backwards.

798
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,540
Let's start with the assumption
that Vplus minus

799
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,790
Vminus is very small.

800
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,460
And that lets us solve the
circuits very quickly.

801
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,600
So for example, the same circuit
that took, previously,

802
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,080
a few lines to get the answer
to, if I just take as a rule

803
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,600
that Vplus has to be Vminus,
it's a one step.

804
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,130
Vplus equals Vminus, OK, Vi
equals Vo, period, done.

805
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,450
It's a very simple way to think
about the answer to an

806
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,600
op-amp circuit.

807
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,760
So if the op-amp can be
represented by a voltage

808
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,140
controlled voltage source and if
K is very large, then Vplus

809
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,490
is roughly Vminus.

810
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,480
Shortcut, ideal op-amp
assumption.

811
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,325
So, use that or ignore
it depending on

812
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:18,360
what your mood is.

813
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,560
And figure out the voltage
relationship for this slightly

814
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,810
more complicated circuit.

815
00:46:22,810 --> 00:48:30,540

816
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,790
So what's the answer?

817
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,340

818
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,360
Yes?

819
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,400
No.

820
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,080
How many are done?

821
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,260
How many are not done?

822
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,510
OK, take a minute.

823
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,290

824
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,540
This is supposed to be easy.

825
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,610

826
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,860
Think ideal op-amp.

827
00:48:50,860 --> 00:50:46,680

828
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,830
OK, what's the output?

829
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,610
Everybody raise your hand,
what's the output?

830
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,390

831
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:56,980
More hands, more hands,
more hands.

832
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:01,860
OK, tiny number of hands, but
those who showed hands are

833
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,200
about 100% correct.

834
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,460
I don't know how
to grade that.

835
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,760
Small participation, 100%
among those who did

836
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,760
participate.

837
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,830
So how do I think about this?

838
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,080
What's step (1)?

839
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:17,460

840
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,950
All right, according to the
theory of lectures,

841
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,942
what is step (1)?

842
00:51:21,942 --> 00:51:23,436
AUDIENCE: Look at the
previous slide.

843
00:51:23,436 --> 00:51:25,440
PROFESSOR: Look at the
previous slide, yes.

844
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,120
What was the previous slide?

845
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:37,535
OK The previous slide
had to do with?

846
00:51:37,535 --> 00:51:38,465
AUDIENCE: The ideal op-amps.

847
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:39,395
PROFESSOR: Ideal op-amps.

848
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:42,250
What's ideal op-amps say?

849
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,070
Vplus equals Vminus.

850
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,085
What happens here if Vplus
is equal to Vminus?

851
00:51:46,085 --> 00:51:50,940

852
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,473
Well what's Vplus?

853
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:53,400
AUDIENCE: 0.

854
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,260
PROFESSOR: So what's Vminus?

855
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,960
AUDIENCE: 0.

856
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,390
PROFESSOR: 0.

857
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,010
So if Vminus is 0,
what do I do now?

858
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:09,453

859
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:12,450
That bad, that hard huh?

860
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,850
Well, I got a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
here in which three different

861
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,710
currents can flow.

862
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:19,570
How big is the current that
can come into this node?

863
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,630
What's the sum of all the
currents that can

864
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,060
come into that node?

865
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,680
Well one could come
in this way.

866
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,750
One could come in that way.

867
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,080
One could come in that way.

868
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,024
How much current flows in the
minus lead of the op-amp?

869
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:34,452
AUDIENCE: 0.

870
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:34,880
AUDIENCE: 0.

871
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,170
PROFESSOR: None.

872
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,210
No current goes into
the minus.

873
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,500
No current enters the op-amp
through the minus lead.

874
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,240
So it's the sum of
three currents.

875
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,490
How big is this current?

876
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,010

877
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:52,595
How big is the current that
flows in that lead?

878
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:53,460
V1 --

879
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,570
V1 over 1, right?

880
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,670
Ohm's Law.

881
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,210
So this node is 0.

882
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,590
That node is V1.

883
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:05,110
The voltage across this resistor
is V1 minus 0.

884
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,030
The voltage across is V1.

885
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,600
The current is V1
over R. R is 1.

886
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,320
So the current that flows
in this leg is V1.

887
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,460
How much current flows
in this leg?

888
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,944
How much current flows
in this leg?

889
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:20,850
AUDIENCE: V0.

890
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,910
PROFESSOR: V0.

891
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,410
The idea is that the total
current that flows into this

892
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:32,350
node is V1 plus V2 plus V0.

893
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,660
Solve for V0.

894
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,000
V0 is minus V1 minus V2.

895
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,030

896
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:40,440
Right?

897
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,690
Got it?

898
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,640

899
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,040
The idea was that this is really
easy to solve if you

900
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,160
use the ideal op-amp
approximation.

901
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,410
You can see that this is 0.

902
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,480
Therefore, this is 0.

903
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,520
So you have a single
KCL equation.

904
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,930
And the result is that this
circuit looks like an

905
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:01,480
inverting summer.

906
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,060
It computes the sum of V1 and V2
and then takes the negative

907
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,450
of that and presents
that at the output.

908
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,850
What I'm trying to motivate is
that there's a whole different

909
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:15,120
level of reasoning that you
can do when you have this

910
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,110
element, which is an op-amp.

911
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,640
Here what we've done is we've
made something that performs a

912
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,980
numerical operation.

913
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,780
It presents, at the output,
the negative

914
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,030
sum of the two inputs.

915
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,050

916
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,680
OK another problem.

917
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,720
Determine R so that V0
is twice V1 minus V2.

918
00:54:34,720 --> 00:59:18,620

919
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,870
So how should I choose R?

920
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:26,100

921
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,030
Not very many hands.

922
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,610
This is the perfect nano
quiz practice, right?

923
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,530
This looks like a perfect nano
quiz question, right?

924
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,780
Smile.

925
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,300

926
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,550
So what's the answer?

927
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,890

928
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,850
OK we're down to about
half correct.

929
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,880
This is harder.

930
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,580
Basically you do exactly the
same thing, it's just that

931
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:55,090
it's a little algebraically
messier.

932
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,840
So not surprisingly, the first
idea is to think about the

933
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,080
ideal op-amp.

934
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,300
We'll think about what was the
voltage here, what was the

935
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,970
voltage there, and then
we'll equate them.

936
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:09,310

937
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,220
What's the voltage
at the plus lead?

938
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,020
Well that's easy.

939
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,840
That's just a voltage
divider here.

940
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,830
Since no current flows in
here, I can compute the

941
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:21,880
voltage relative to this ground
as R over (1 plus R).

942
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,110
That's showed here.

943
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,625
Times V1.

944
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:27,510

945
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,010
This one's a little bit trickier
because I've got two

946
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,820
sources, V2 and V0,
each pumping

947
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,000
current into this place.

948
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,480
The way I thought about it was
start with V2 and then add to

949
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,280
it this component, which can
be thought of as a voltage

950
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,420
divider here.

951
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,050
So how big is the voltage
at Vminus?

952
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:54,620
Well it's V2 plus a voltage
divider here,

953
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,320
which is given by this.

954
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,330
That's a little tricky.

955
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,930
If you're not comfortable with
that step, you could also

956
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,160
solve for that voltage using
the node method.

957
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,080

958
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,760
The node method will give
you the same answer.

959
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,390
The answer is that the voltage
at the Vminus port is two

960
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,930
thirds of V2 and one
third of V0.

961
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,060
That sort of looks right because
the resistors are in a

962
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,310
ratio of 2:1.

963
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:23,810

964
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,750
And then using the ideal op-amp
assumption, we equate

965
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,880
the two, do some more algebra,
and we get some relationship

966
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,150
and figure out that R is 2.

967
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,560

968
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,200
The point is that this is a

969
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,210
relatively complicated circuit.

970
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,360
You could have done it if I had
asked you to do it with

971
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,960
the voltage controlled
voltage source model.

972
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,140
But the algebra is already
hard here with the ideal

973
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,460
op-amp assumption, and with the
voltage controlled voltage

974
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,900
source it's even harder.

975
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,900
So the idea is that the ideal
op-amp assumption, the idea

976
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:01,710
that Vplus is equal to Vminus,
makes the work of calculating

977
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:06,210
these responses significantly
easier.

978
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:07,960
Everybody's with the
bottom line?

979
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:14,890

980
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:18,630
We started with the idea that
when you add an element to a

981
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:23,990
circuit, in general, adding an
element changes voltages and

982
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,690
currents throughout
the circuit.

983
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:31,020
We wanted a way to make the
design more modular, a way of

984
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:36,310
adding a component without
changing everything else.

985
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:40,330
We thought about this
op-amp thing.

986
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:42,720
The model for the op-amp
was voltage

987
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,780
controlled voltage source.

988
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:48,410
We inferred this ideal
op-amp model.

989
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:50,220
The ideal op-amp model
was great for

990
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,060
calculating the response.

991
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,780
It has this one problem.

992
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,350
It seems to say these circuits
are identical.

993
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,870

994
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:05,530
If I literally believe the ideal
op-amp assumption that

995
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:08,940
all the op-amp does is magically
make the plus and

996
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,600
minus terminals the same, I
would conclude that this

997
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,820
circuit where the input comes
in the plus and the output

998
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:22,570
wraps around to the minus
generates precisely the same

999
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:25,510
input-output relationship as
this one, where the input

1000
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:30,410
comes in the minus and the
output wraps around the plus.

1001
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,800
The ideal op-amp assumption
simply says for both of those,

1002
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,060
Vi equals Vo.

1003
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:42,110
So I would assume from the ideal
op-amp model I get the

1004
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,570
result that these two circuits
work exactly the same way.

1005
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,910
Somehow that sounds wrong.

1006
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,950

1007
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:54,540
I've got this part, and
I can wire it up the

1008
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,760
right way and it works.

1009
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,440
Or I can flip the two wires,
and it still works.

1010
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,080
Conservation of badness
doesn't let

1011
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,160
that happen, right?

1012
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,875
If you do something bad,
it should break.

1013
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:06,860

1014
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:09,160
The ideal op-amp assumption
seems to

1015
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,200
lead to a bogus result.

1016
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,570
It seems to say these
two are the same.

1017
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:16,810
So what I'd like to do is think
about that for a moment.

1018
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,160
We want to be comfortable with
the assumption that we make.

1019
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:22,480
The ideal op-amp assumption
makes analysis really easy,

1020
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,090
but we'd like to understand
exactly what we're assuming.

1021
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:27,550
This just doesn't sound right.

1022
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:28,880
OK, so let's back up.

1023
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,590

1024
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,360
Let's not do the ideal
op-amp assumption.

1025
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,320
Let's Instead say that we use
the voltage controlled voltage

1026
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,240
source model.

1027
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,980
So what I've done here
is substitute

1028
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,760
into the left circuit.

1029
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,890
So this circuit is shown here
and the other over here.

1030
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,520
All I've done is connected the
input either to the plus or to

1031
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,640
the minus port and wrapped
the other one around.

1032
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,180
But now I'm analyzing it using
the voltage controlled voltage

1033
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,100
source model.

1034
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,540
And I've done the
tedious algebra.

1035
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,840
And I don't think there's
any mistakes

1036
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,190
in the tedious algebra.

1037
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,690
In one case I get K over
(1 plus K), which for

1038
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,541
large K is about 1.

1039
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:15,150
In the other case I get minus K
over (1 minus K), which for

1040
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:17,460
K large is about 1.

1041
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,090
The ideal op-amp assumption says
that it doesn't matter.

1042
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,690
The voltage controlled
voltage source model

1043
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,640
says it doesn't matter.

1044
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,130
And Freeman thinks this doesn't
make any sense.

1045
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:30,210

1046
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,830
So what's going on here?

1047
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:39,770
What's going on is that we've
actually made an enormous leap

1048
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,420
in thinking about the op-amp
even as a voltage controlled

1049
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,670
voltage source.

1050
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:45,530

1051
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:48,370
The two models that we talked
about, the voltage controlled

1052
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,270
voltage source and the ideal
op-amp model, are great for

1053
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:53,900
calculating answers.

1054
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:58,410
They are not so good at
providing a mechanism for how

1055
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,300
the op-amp is actually
working.

1056
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,300
Think about just the ideal
op-amp assumption.

1057
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,020
It's great to think, OK, the
op-amp is going to do whatever

1058
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,770
magic is necessary to make
these two leads the same.

1059
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:12,580

1060
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,350
Well how does it do that?

1061
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:17,580
The thing about the ideal op-amp
assumption is that it

1062
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:21,730
doesn't tell you the mechanism
by which that happens.

1063
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:27,530
What does the op-amp actually
do in order to get

1064
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,730
Vplus equal to Vminus?

1065
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:31,660
What's actually going on
inside the op-amp?

1066
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:36,650
The ideal op-amp assumption is
very good for analysis and not

1067
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,000
very good with mechanism.

1068
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,120
What's the mechanism?

1069
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,170
What's the op-amp
actually doing?

1070
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:45,080

1071
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,120
What it's really doing is
moving charge around.

1072
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,800

1073
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,220
8.02 --

1074
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,480
charge.

1075
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,010
So if you're going to have a
change in voltage, there has

1076
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,900
to be motion of charge.

1077
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,870
And that's what's missing from
the voltage controlled voltage

1078
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,520
model and from the ideal
op-amp model.

1079
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,380
How do you think about
moving charge around?

1080
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,180
Well it's the same as
moving water around.

1081
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,050
Somehow, I think it's all those
years of playing with

1082
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,870
water when I was a little kid,
I find my intuition about

1083
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:16,260
water is better than my
intuition about charge.

1084
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,045
So let me start by thinking
about the intuition for water.

1085
01:07:19,045 --> 01:07:22,310

1086
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:26,030
The way a water tank works is
if the flow in is different

1087
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:27,320
from the flow out, the
height changes.

1088
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:30,010

1089
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,870
That's continuity.

1090
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:37,800
So if the water is conserved,
if there's not significant

1091
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,570
evaporation over the duration
of this experiment, or if

1092
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:43,610
molecules of water do not
spontaneously disappear or

1093
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:48,220
appear, under either of those
two assumptions, then the

1094
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:50,560
change in the height is
proportional to the difference

1095
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,400
between the rate at which it's
coming in and the rate at

1096
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,490
which it's coming out.

1097
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,340
If the rate at which it's going
out is equal to the rate

1098
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,590
at which it's going in, there's
no change in height.

1099
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:59,360
If it's coming in faster,
it's going up.

1100
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,070
If it's coming in slower,
it's going down.

1101
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:05,040
All easy, right?

1102
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,410
Charge works the same way.

1103
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:09,720

1104
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,790
The thing that accumulates
charge in an electronic

1105
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,230
circuit is a capacitor.

1106
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:18,990
And there's a direct analogy
between thinking about the way

1107
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:23,569
the flux of water generates
height and the way flux of

1108
01:08:23,569 --> 01:08:27,200
charge generates volts.

1109
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:33,680
So we can think about the flux
of charge, that's current.

1110
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,990
If there's a net flux, if
there's a bigger current into

1111
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,330
a capacitor then there is
out, the voltage on that

1112
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,640
capacitor goes up.

1113
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,420
If there's a smaller current in
than goes out, the voltage

1114
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,609
on the capacitor goes down
just like the height

1115
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:51,940
in a tank of water.

1116
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,470

1117
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:57,060
We can make a much more
realistic model for the way an

1118
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,460
op-amp works by explicitly
making a representation for

1119
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,899
how the charge flows.

1120
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:07,890
And that's shown here.

1121
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,930
I'm going to take the voltage
controlled voltage source

1122
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:15,290
model but explicitly make a
representation for the output

1123
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,550
charging up.

1124
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,590
What's the op-amp do?

1125
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:22,080
The op-amp senses the voltage
at the input and the output

1126
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,270
and does something to change
the voltage at the output.

1127
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:32,229
The thing it does is if the
positive voltage is greater

1128
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:35,680
than the negative voltage,
it pumps charge

1129
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:39,359
into the output node.

1130
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,689
If the opposite occurs,
it sucks charge out.

1131
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:48,950
Now it's important, this is not
an accurate depiction of

1132
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,260
what's inside an op-amp.

1133
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:55,190
This is the model
for an op-amp.

1134
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:58,210
I don't want to lead any of
you to think that this is

1135
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,620
literally what's in an op-amp.

1136
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:02,110
This is not literally
what's in an op-amp.

1137
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:06,060
Here is much more literally
what's in an op-amp.

1138
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:09,120
This is the schematic
diagram of a 709

1139
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,410
which is a Widlar circuit.

1140
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:14,060
It's a complicated transistor
circuit.

1141
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,310
It's ingenious.

1142
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,330

1143
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,660
This is how you build a
circuit that has the

1144
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,530
remarkable property of the
ideal op-amp circuit.

1145
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,065
It's not perfectly obvious
from here.

1146
01:10:25,065 --> 01:10:29,270
And even here this doesn't give
Widlar enough credit.

1147
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,000
Here's what he really did.

1148
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,120
He designed masks to shield
semiconductor materials so

1149
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,710
that you could turn them into
transistors so that it would

1150
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,390
turn into an op-amp.

1151
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:42,100
We're not going to
worry about this.

1152
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,560
This is two levels of
abstraction more complex than

1153
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,370
we're going to worry about.

1154
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:50,410
We're just going to say, I don't
know what's in there,

1155
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,960
but this is the way
it behaves.

1156
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:56,870
This is intended to be a
behavioral model for how an

1157
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:57,380
op-amp works.

1158
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,670
And in fact, that's
an important

1159
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:03,290
idea that we use circuits--

1160
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:06,440
I use circuits on a daily basis
not because I design

1161
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,280
semiconductor devices
but because I work

1162
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,970
on biological issues.

1163
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:12,830
I actually study hearing.

1164
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:17,500
And we make circuit models for
the way biological parts work.

1165
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,490
And that helps us to understand
the way the

1166
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:21,810
biological part works.

1167
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:26,400
For example, here is a model
taken from 6.021, where we try

1168
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:31,060
to understand how a nerve
propagates an action potential

1169
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,490
by making a circuit model.

1170
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,160

1171
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,540
That's the same thing
we're doing here.

1172
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:41,100
We're making a circuit model
for how the op-amp works.

1173
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,550
it's not intended
to be literally

1174
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:43,590
what's inside the op-amp.

1175
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,110
It's intended to be a model that
let's us think about the

1176
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:48,940
behavior of the op-amp.

1177
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,510
This lets us understand now why
it's different when you

1178
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:52,760
flip the wires.

1179
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,070

1180
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:58,580
Let's start with the original
configuration where I put the

1181
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,880
voltage in the plus lead, and I
wrap the output back around

1182
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,750
to the minus lead.

1183
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,800
What's going to happen?

1184
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,550
What's the op-amp actually do?

1185
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,900
Imagine that things
had been stable.

1186
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,020
This was 0.

1187
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,430
The output was 0.

1188
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,980
Everybody was happy.

1189
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:20,670
And now all of a sudden the
input voltages steps up.

1190
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,300
What happens?

1191
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,440
The input voltage steps up.

1192
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,440
The voltage source suddenly
generates a

1193
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,720
huge positive voltage.

1194
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,330
And that starts to put current
into the capacitor that

1195
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:37,340
represents the voltage at the
output of the op-amp.

1196
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:41,200
So as a result of this voltage
being higher than where it

1197
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:46,260
was, current is being dumped
by the op-amp into this

1198
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,310
capacitor, and the output
voltage starts to increase.

1199
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,560
That's shown it red.

1200
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,000

1201
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,310
As the capacitor voltage gets
bigger, as the output voltage

1202
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:59,510
increases, the difference
between Vplus and Vminus gets

1203
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:05,450
smaller, and the rate at which
charge is flowing into the

1204
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:08,270
capacitor slows.

1205
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:11,560
And in fact, as the voltage at
the output gets very close to

1206
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,060
the voltage at the input, the
rate of current into the

1207
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,530
capacitor goes to 0.

1208
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:19,520
And the output voltage
stabilizes

1209
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,450
at the input voltage.

1210
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:25,120
The same thing happens in
reverse if I were to change

1211
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,455
input voltage and make
it go negative.

1212
01:13:27,455 --> 01:13:30,000

1213
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,500
If the input voltage went
negative, then K times Vplus

1214
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,290
minus Vminus would be a big
negative number and it would

1215
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:41,810
suck current out.

1216
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:45,490
The voltage controlled voltage
source would suck current out

1217
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:49,270
of the capacitor and make
the voltage fall.

1218
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:50,360
The voltage would fall.

1219
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,680
The absolute difference between
the plus and minus

1220
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,660
port would get smaller.

1221
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:58,080
The current flowing
would become less.

1222
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,600
And it would again stabilize
when the output is

1223
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,850
equal to the input.

1224
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:05,670

1225
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:10,310
Contrast that to what would
happen if I put the input into

1226
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:13,450
the minus port.

1227
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:17,480
If I put the input into the
minus port, and the input goes

1228
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:24,450
through a step, then the input
going positive makes the

1229
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,360
voltage controlled voltage
source generate a

1230
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,870
big negative voltage.

1231
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,390
It sucks current out.

1232
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:31,735
So the input went positive.

1233
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:35,160

1234
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,590
And the output goes negative.

1235
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:39,540
It goes the wrong way.

1236
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,190
That's bad.

1237
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:46,480
So here, if I put the input
into the minus lead, a

1238
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,830
positive transition of the
input leads to the output

1239
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:51,910
going the wrong way.

1240
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:56,050
And as it goes the wrong way,
the drive to make it go the

1241
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,470
wrong way gets bigger.

1242
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,530
It's a runaway system.

1243
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,670
It's positive feedback.

1244
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:06,520
So the idea is that by
supporting the input into the

1245
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,840
negative lead instead of into
the positive lead, leads to a

1246
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,780
positive feedback situation in
which a small change at the

1247
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:19,190
input makes the output go the
wrong way, convinces the

1248
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:21,750
op-amp that things are getting
worse, so it makes even more

1249
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:25,450
current, which makes it go
even more the wrong way.

1250
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:31,050
And the same thing happens
with the flip situation.

1251
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:33,660
The idea then is that
by thinking

1252
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,010
about the flow of current--

1253
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,160
What's the op-amp
actually doing?

1254
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,910
The op-amp is actually sensing
the difference between the

1255
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:42,330
voltage at the positive port and
the minus port, and it's

1256
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:45,360
sourcing current that
changes the output

1257
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,540
voltage to go up or down.

1258
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:56,520
You need to wire the op-amp so
that ultimately the output

1259
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,450
equals the input.

1260
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,840
Otherwise the ideal op-amp
condition that Vplus equals

1261
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,670
Vminus will ever be attained.

1262
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:08,870
So the left one is what we would
refer to as a stable

1263
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:11,350
feedback situation.

1264
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:14,580
You can think about that as
analogous to thinking about a

1265
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:16,950
ball in a valley.

1266
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:19,850
So we have a valley,
and we have a ball.

1267
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,430
The ball's going to roll
down here eventually.

1268
01:16:22,430 --> 01:16:23,970
It's stable.

1269
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:26,270
Bop it a little bit to the
right, it'll roll back into

1270
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:26,700
the valley.

1271
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,130
Bop it a little to the
left, it'll roll

1272
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,260
back into the valley.

1273
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:32,670
That's as opposed to, when we've
wired up the wrong way,

1274
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:36,010
it's like we have an unstable
equilibrium.

1275
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:39,470
It's as though we're trying
to put the ball there.

1276
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:43,200
Bop it a little to right, it
runs away to the right.

1277
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,680
Bop it a little to the left,
it runs away to the left.

1278
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,730
That's unstable.

1279
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,760
There is a metastability
plane.

1280
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,420
If you actually balanced it
exactly, exactly, exactly at

1281
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:58,530
the right place, it
would stay there.

1282
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,290
That's what the solution
is telling you.

1283
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:04,370
That was the minus K
over (1 minus K).

1284
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,140
The fact that the equations
had a solution is correct,

1285
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,150
it's just an unstable
solution.

1286
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:15,530
The tiniest little disturbance
will make it go awry.

1287
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,770
The idea then is that
the ideal op-amp

1288
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:19,990
assumption is fine.

1289
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:21,080
It's a good thing to use.

1290
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,380
It doesn't tell you about
the mechanism.

1291
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,460
If you think a little bit more
about the way the physics

1292
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:30,170
works, you have to wire the
circuit up so that it has

1293
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:35,740
negative feedback in order to
get a stable equilibrium.

1294
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:38,230
So if you understand that, and
you just make sure that you've

1295
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,680
hooked it up so that it has
negative feedback, then you

1296
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,600
can use the ideal op-amp
assumption.

1297
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,290
Everything's just fine.

1298
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:46,500
And in the interest of time,
I'm going to just skip over

1299
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,840
this because we've already
talked about all of this.

1300
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,650
It's just another example.

1301
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:53,750
The last thing I want to mention
is just that in order

1302
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:58,140
to work this magic,
the op-amp has to

1303
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,455
get power from somewhere.

1304
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:03,670

1305
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:06,640
And so that means that it's not
a three-terminal device.

1306
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,590
It's not the kind of device I've
been drawing so far that

1307
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,990
has got power pins too.

1308
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:13,640

1309
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,930
The way the op-amp works is it
takes power from those power

1310
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:21,630
pins to be able to force the
output to a voltage that'll

1311
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,780
make the input the Vplus
equal to Vminus.

1312
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,750
That's the mechanism
by which it works.

1313
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:30,150
And that'll have important
consequences when we build the

1314
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:34,820
robot head, because what it
means is that we're not going

1315
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,480
to be able to generate arbitrary
voltages at the

1316
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,020
output of an op-amp.

1317
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,600
We're going to be limited to
generating voltages that are

1318
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,510
between the power rails.

1319
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,630
So if we were to supply plus
and minus 10 Volts to the

1320
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,780
power pins, we would not be
expecting to be able to

1321
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,800
generate 20 Volts
at the output.

1322
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,650
So that's an important
implication when we do the

1323
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:57,560
design lab.

1324
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,260
In summary, what we've done is
we've showed how circuits can

1325
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:05,600
be a pain to make modular,
because in principle, adding

1326
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,950
one component changes voltages
and currents everywhere.

1327
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:11,580
But there's a way using op-amps
to have this buffering

1328
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,420
idea that lets us logically
separate parts of circuits so

1329
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,562
the one can control the other.

1330
01:19:17,562 --> 01:19:18,812
Have a good day.

1331
01:19:18,812 --> 01:19:27,703
