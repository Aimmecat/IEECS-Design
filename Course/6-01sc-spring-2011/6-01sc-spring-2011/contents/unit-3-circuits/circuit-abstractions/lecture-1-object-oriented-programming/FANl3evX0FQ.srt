8
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,650
PROFESSOR: So today I
want to finish up

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,900
thinking about circuits.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,460
And the major topic for
today is just one --

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,890
thinking about abstractions that
we can use for thinking

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,690
about circuits.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,220
The attractions are things that
capitalize on linearity.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,560
And they include things like
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,810
superposition.

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,430
OK so what I want to
do is finish up

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,760
thinking about circuits.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,900
And just to get you thinking
about circuits, let's think

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,770
about where we are.

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,840
Last time we saw that one of the
issues in thinking about

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,380
circuit design, is the fact that
every part, in principle,

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,040
interacts with every
other part.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,210
Which makes the design process
harder than the design process

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,580
was for things like linear
systems, where we thought

25
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,240
about boxes having inputs
and outputs.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,300
In linear systems, when we
thought about boxes having

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,260
inputs and outputs, the output
didn't necessarily have any

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,230
affect on the input,
unless there was an

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,490
explicit path feedback.

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,830
In circuits, there's
feedback always.

31
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,070
There's no way to avoid it.

32
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,320
And in fact, that coupling can
make thinking about the

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,380
circuits very difficult.

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,530
And we introduce that idea by
just thinking about, even if

35
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,110
you wanted to close a switch,
you know a circuit, that's

36
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,760
logically the same as
adding a new part.

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,050
And when you do that, that's
going to change the currents

38
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,320
and voltages everywhere.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,250
So that's kind of a big thing--
that's kind of the

40
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,500
thing that's different about
circuits from what we've been

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,750
thinking about before.

42
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,330
Because that complicates design,
we'd like some way of

43
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,110
dealing with it.

44
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,850
And the way we introduced, and
the way that you used in the

45
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,280
lab, so far, has been
to use a buffer.

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,620
We can use an op-amp
to make a buffer.

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,480
And a buffer has this nice
isolation property.

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,010
In this particular circuit, it
has the property that it

49
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,820
copies this voltage to the
output, regardless of what's

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,070
at the output.

51
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,340
That means we could put a switch
here, we could change

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,760
the light bulb, we could do
anything we wanted to, and we

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,190
would still know, because of the
properties of the op-amp,

54
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,677
we would still know that this
voltage is going to be 8

55
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,730
Volts, regardless of
what we put there.

56
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,890
So that's very nice, that gives
us a modularity, that

57
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,600
gives us a way to
design things.

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,990
It let's us design the left--

59
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,580
make a circuit that generates
8 Volts without knowing

60
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,030
precisely what's going
to be the ultimate

61
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,820
circuit that that drives.

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,910
So that's nice, it allows
us to do modularity.

63
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,650
And in many instances, that's
a very good solution.

64
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,310
In fact in the solution-- in
the problems that you are

65
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,320
working on in lab, where you're

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,280
trying to drive a motor--

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,710
that's an excellent solution.

68
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,200
It's not always an excellent
solution.

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,590
In some sense, it's
very expensive.

70
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,620
An op-amp is a complicated
part.

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,860
If you were to look inside an
op-amp, there's some two dozen

72
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,470
transistors in most op-amps.

73
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,190
So it's not an inexpensive
part, especially when you

74
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,310
think about this kind of a
circuit that only has three

75
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,770
parts to the left.

76
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,110
The op-amp is actually a more
complex device than

77
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,370
anything else up.

78
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,700
So op-amps are wonderful,
op-amps allow us to make

79
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,060
buffers, buffers are wonderful,
but they're not

80
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,540
always the best solution for
thinking about modularity.

81
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,940
And, in fact, there's
other ways.

82
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,020
And so that's what we want to
think about today is -- other

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,800
ways for achieving modularity
in circuit design.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,830
And the key to thinking about
this, is to think about, well,

85
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,540
what's the worst thing
that could happen?

86
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,440
If I changed this part
arbitrarily, just how bad can

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,690
things get?

88
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,640
So I'll let you answer that.

89
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,459
Think about that circuit, and
assume that this is a 90 Volt

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,680
power supply, 3 Ohm, 6 Ohm,
but this can change--

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,930
R0 can change.

92
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,650
I've tabulated some values of R0
and putative, corresponding

93
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,270
values for V0 and I0.

94
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,920
Are my putative answers right?

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,150
So take a minute, talk to
your neighbor, figure

96
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,710
out how many of these--

97
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,220
let's see-- ten blue numbers
are right or wrong.

98
00:05:40,613 --> 00:05:42,470
It's very quiet, you are allowed
to talk to people.

99
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,160
So how many of the numbers
are wrong?

100
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,230
So raise your hand, indicate
by number fingers how many

101
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,790
mistakes are in the table.

102
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,820
More votes, more votes--

103
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,110
come on, come on.

104
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,900
if you had talked more, you
could blame it on your

105
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,100
neighbor more easily,
so talk quickly.

106
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,330
OK.

107
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,585
So does everybody agree
with their neighbor?

108
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,100
OK, i don't see a single
right answer.

109
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,429
So take 30 more seconds and
think about it again.

110
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,590
I don't see any right answers.

111
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,261
So assume your answer's wrong.

112
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,690
[CHUCKLES]

113
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,380
Color blind--

114
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,180
OK, so how many of
the voltages and

115
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,430
currents are incorrect?

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,950
OK, how about a re-vote?

117
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,620
So how many of the
blue numbers--

118
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,890
the currents and voltages,
how many of V0 and I0 --

119
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,140
how many of those
are incorrect?

120
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,970
OK, not very many votes--

121
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,150
I'd say about 80%
correct, now.

122
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,020
That's definitely
an improvement.

123
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,300
What would have to be true?

124
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,590
If I wanted to prove that some
of these numbers were wrong,

125
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,340
what could I do?

126
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,490
Give me a condition that would
have to be true if the numbers

127
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,740
were correct.

128
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:48,004
AUDIENCE: V0 has to equal I0?

129
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,140
PROFESSOR: V0 has to equal I0.

130
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,460
We know that this resistor
better be--

131
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,080
better obey Ohm's Law.

132
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,940
That's what we mean
by that symbol.

133
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,750
So it had better be the
case that V0 is I0R0.

134
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,920
So you you'd want this
number to be the

135
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,600
product of that and that.

136
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,810
So 0 is the product of 0 and
30, that looks good.

137
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,750
30 is 2 times 15, 36 is 3 times
12, 48 is 6 times 8.

138
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,320
60 is--

139
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,000
well that's a little marginal.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,630
how about if I rearrange it
a little bit, and say

141
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,880
what if R is V/I?

142
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,770
If I is 0, that would make the
resistor infinity, so there's

143
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,180
a way of thinking about that
last line as correct.

144
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,160
That's a little funny.

145
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,280
Maybe the forward way of
thinking about it is, well

146
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,700
what if I made the resistor
infinite?

147
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,060
if I made the resistor infinite,
what would be I?

148
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,330
0.

149
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,580
And what would be V?

150
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,175
What would be the voltage
difference if

151
00:10:50,175 --> 00:10:52,887
this were right, then?

152
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:53,873
The voltage divider--

153
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:54,859
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

154
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,063
PROFESSOR: So if there's no
current here, then you can use

155
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,800
the voltage relationship--
the voltage-divider

156
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,070
relationship here.

157
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,240
6 over (3 plus 6) times 90 --

158
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,290
which is 60.

159
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,820
So if you use straightforward
reasoning saying, what if the

160
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,150
resistor was infinitely large?

161
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,990
What would happen?

162
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,760
Then you would conclude that
the bottom line is OK.

163
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,630
If you choose--

164
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,770
if you show that R equals
V over I, are you done?

165
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,800
What else has to be true
in order for the

166
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,050
numbers to be true?

167
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,370
It's not very hard.

168
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,306
AUDIENCE: The voltages drop out
of the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

169
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:37,790
The resistor has to be
the same as the--

170
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,330
PROFESSOR: So the voltages--

171
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,300
that's an instance--

172
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,310
what you just said-- is
an instance of KVL.

173
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,360
Basically, the voltage around
all of the loops better be 0.

174
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,550
The sum of the voltages around
all of the loops better be 0,

175
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,290
and the sum of the currents in
all of those closed surfaces

176
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,250
better be 0, right?

177
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,540
KVL better be satisfied
everywhere, and KCL better be

178
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,240
satisfied everywhere.

179
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,740
So, in particular, we can
ask about this node.

180
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,660
We could say, do the currents
flowing into

181
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,580
that node sum to 0?

182
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,560
So if you take a line here--
let's take this line--

183
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,710
if V0 happened to be--

184
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,070
V0 happens to be the voltage
here, right?

185
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,730
So if V0 were 36, then that puts
some voltage on this leg.

186
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,353
36 would what, 54?

187
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,500
So then you'd have to say--

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,420
you'd have to compute, then, the
current through here and

189
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,410
the current through there,
and see if those

190
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,790
currents sum to 0.

191
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,890
And, in fact, if you do those
calculations, you if you can

192
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,830
convince yourself of
those are all true.

193
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,690
So the answer was 0.

194
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,640
All of those answers
were true.

195
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,320
The point of doing the exercise
was to just remind

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,260
you about how you solve
circuits, but also to let us

197
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,090
look at patterns.

198
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,650
The interesting thing in this
problem is the pattern the

199
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,140
results between the
V's and the I's.

200
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,290
So if I were to make a plot, in
fact, those V's and I's all

201
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,180
fall on a straight line.

202
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,400
Well that's pretty
interesting.

203
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,720
So if I plot just this
V versus this I--

204
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,974
so V equals 0, 30, 36,
0, 30, 36, 48, 60 --

205
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,380
and the corresponding
I's, 30,15,12,6,0 --

206
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,360
30,15,12,6,0.

207
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,190
Those points all fall
on a straight line.

208
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,820
That suggests that there's
some pattern here.

209
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,630
And if there's a pattern, then
there might be a way to

210
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,730
exploit it.

211
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,720
So that's what I'm trying
to develop--

212
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,840
is a way to exploit the pattern
that results when

213
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,470
parts of circuits interact.

214
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,180
The interesting thing
that we--

215
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,160
so not only is it true that
there's a simple pattern, but

216
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,370
it turns out that the pattern
is completely independent of

217
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,003
the thing that I put
on the right.

218
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:06,165
The pattern is a property of
the circuit to the left.

219
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,170
One way to convince yourself
of that is to substitute--

220
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,120
take that resistor out, and put
in a voltage source, and

221
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,540
redo the problem.

222
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,180
This time, instead of assuming
that there's an Ohm's Law-type

223
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,120
resistor here, assume there's
a constant voltage, and that

224
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,410
constant voltage is adjusted
to 0,30,36,48,60.

225
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,600
If you re-solve that
problem, you get

226
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,930
exactly these same currents.

227
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,710
The answer continues to fall
on exactly the same line.

228
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,270
So that's a very interesting
pattern.

229
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:46,800
The idea is that when the
circuit on the left interacts

230
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,430
with the circuit on the right,
regardless of what the circuit

231
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,490
on the right is, you get a
simple relationship between

232
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,730
the voltage and current
that comes out of the

233
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,980
circuit on the left.

234
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,510
So that motivates the idea that
we can think about the

235
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:09,260
left-hand circuit as some
kind of a generic part.

236
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,490
We call that generic
part a one-port.

237
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,750
Think about this circuit on the
left-- the thing that's in

238
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,100
the red box--

239
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,120
it's got at its terminals--

240
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,490
the terminals are the things
that poke through the red box.

241
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,530
First off it has two terminals,
two terminals is

242
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,760
just like all of our
other parts.

243
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,020
And it's like a resistor, it's
like a voltage source, it's

244
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,800
like a current source, it's
a two terminal device.

245
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,460
And just like a voltage source
or a resistor or a current

246
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,480
source, there's some voltage
across those terminals, and

247
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,470
there's some current that flows
in those terminals.

248
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,170
So there's some current
that goes in the plus.

249
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,210
And that same current
comes out the minus.

250
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,080
That'll be true for this
circuit, just the same as it's

251
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,780
true for a resistor or voltage
source or anything else, the

252
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,580
only difference is, the thing
that's inside the box--

253
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,100
the thing that's inside
the one-port--

254
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,510
is more complicated than it was
for a simple resistor or

255
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,080
voltage source or
current source.

256
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,550
So what we can think about, is
this whole red box just looks

257
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,320
like a super part.

258
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,700
So the interesting thing that
happens is, this red box

259
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,300
behaves like a one-port,
like a super part.

260
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,510
And just like a resistor has a
relationship between V and I,

261
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,610
V equals IR, Or a voltage source
has some kind of a

262
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,520
constraint, V equals V0.

263
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,250
Or a current source
has some kind of a

264
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,460
constraint, I equals I0.

265
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,740
This funny part has a
relationship between V and I

266
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,340
that's given by that curve.

267
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,180
In some sense, it's not
very different.

268
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,510
So we think that--

269
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,960
so what we want to do now is
figure out the rules that

270
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,780
govern the currents
and voltages that

271
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,030
flow through one-ports.

272
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:03,900
And in particular, how special
was this straight line thing?

273
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,990
I mean if they were always a
straight line, that would be

274
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,960
really easy, right?

275
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,900
So the question--

276
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,650
so the next question I'd like to
ask is, just how often are

277
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,680
we expecting to see straight
lines there?

278
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,260
I already said, the primitive
elements that we think about--

279
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,390
Ohm's Law, resistors, voltage
sources, current sources--

280
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,109
they have straight line
constraints between the

281
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:32,170
voltages and currents that
they can generate.

282
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,080
So think about what I'm doing.

283
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,630
I'm trying to think about a rule
that's going to let me

284
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,370
describe the currents and
voltages into that red box

285
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,340
from the previous slide, much
like I would describe the

286
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,680
voltages and currents in an
Ohm's Law a resistor.

287
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,910
I can tell you the
voltage-current relationship,

288
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,550
V equals IR for an Ohm's
resistor, independent of what

289
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,190
it's connected to.

290
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,850
That's the reasoning that
I'm using here.

291
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,450
I'm going to try to figure out,
independent of what it is

292
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,150
connected to, what will be the
voltage-current relationship

293
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,640
for the red box?

294
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,510
So the question is, when are we
expecting straight lines,

295
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,360
and when are we not expecting
straight lines?

296
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,480
So here's a simple circuit.

297
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,650
Here's a super part made out
of one linear resistor, one

298
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,090
Ohm's Law resistor, and
one voltage source.

299
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,680
What's the current-voltage
relationship for that part?

300
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,280
What if I put a red box around
the whole thing, and asked you

301
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,920
to draw the I-V curve, the
current voltage curve?

302
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,120
Which would it look
like, A,B,C,D --

303
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,670
which should have been
(1), (2), (3), (4) --

304
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,380
so you can raise fingers,
or none of the above?

305
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,440
So take 30 seconds.

306
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,985
Figure out what would be the
I-V curve for this part.

307
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,850
So if you map A to D
into (1) to (4) --

308
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,290
which of those plots describes
the current-voltage

309
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,610
relationship for that circuit?

310
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,890
Map A to D to (1) to (4).

311
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,890
OK, you're quiet, and the
success rate is smaller than

312
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,240
usual, about 50% correct.

313
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,800
Take 30 seconds, reconsider your
answer, try to get this

314
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,050
up to 85% or so.

315
00:22:13,258 --> 00:23:13,150
[CHATTER]

316
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,920
So which is the best plot?

317
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,140
Which plot best characterizes
the circuit on the top?

318
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,620
OK, that's much better.

319
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,000
That's about 75%.

320
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,490
Certainly not 100%,
but better.

321
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,970
OK so how do you think
about this?

322
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,960
One way to think about
it is special cases.

323
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,900
Can you think about any
special cases that are

324
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,450
particularly easy to check?

325
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,680
0 --

326
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,295
OK, what equals 0?

327
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:47,430
AUDIENCE: V or I --

328
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,490
PROFESSOR: V or I --

329
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:48,960
yes.

330
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,340
So what if you were to make --

331
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,120
if you were to make
I equal to 0?

332
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,950
First off, if you made
I equal to 0, what's

333
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,982
special in the plots?

334
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:03,240
If I equals 0, then you
round up x-axis.

335
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,470
Sorry, if you make I
0, what will V be?

336
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,775
If you made I be 0,
how big will be V?

337
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:14,980
5 Volts, right?

338
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,740
If you make I be 0,
then there's no

339
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,700
voltage across the resistor.

340
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,280
So the total voltage here will
be the same as the voltage

341
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,690
across the voltage source,
V equals 5.

342
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,310
So the intersection on the
x-axis should be at the point

343
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,610
V equals 5.

344
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,780
Makes sense?

345
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,400
Now if you said V equals
0, how big would I be?

346
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:46,660
If you set V equal to 0 -- how
do you set V equal to 0?

347
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,654
AUDIENCE: Negative 2.5.

348
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:51,133
PROFESSOR: Negative 2.5, so
what is negative 2.5?

349
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,630
AUDIENCE: The value of I.

350
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,416
PROFESSOR: So do you need--

351
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:59,900
how do we set V equal to 0?

352
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,682
What's the circuit way of
saying, set V equal to 0?

353
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,530
You set V equals 0
in a circuit by--

354
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,450
AUDIENCE: Grounding.

355
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,030
PROFESSOR: --grounding,
by setting it--

356
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,540
by putting in a wire.

357
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,516
So you run a wire from
here to here.

358
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,430
Voltage across a wire
is always 0, right?

359
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,680
So you set something to 0 by
putting a wire across it.

360
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,220
We call that a short circuit.

361
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,990
OK, there's a short path
for the voltage travel.

362
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:34,100
So you put a short circuit here,
and then I becomes V

363
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,330
over R, and the only trick
is that it's up, right?

364
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,050
Current likes to flow down the
electrochemical gradient.

365
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,760
So it likes to go down the
electrical gradient.

366
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,580
So the current is going to
go up, but the reference

367
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,790
direction for this I is down,
so I is minus 2.5.

368
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,310
So the intersection on this
axis is minus 2.5.

369
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,710
So we know that it has to go
through a negative on the

370
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:09,130
bottom, and it has to go through
a positive V on the

371
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,670
x-axis, and the only curve
that does that is (A).

372
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,180
And if we wanted to be a little
bit more fancy, we

373
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,210
could figure out the
general rule.

374
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,870
We could just write an
expression for Vr.

375
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,040
Well by KVL, Vr is always
the difference

376
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,190
between V and 5 Volts.

377
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,040
And we could write an expression
for the current

378
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,780
through the resistor.

379
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,730
That's just V over R. Vr
is V minus 5, R is 2.

380
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,770
So I get some expression which
is, lo and behold, linear in

381
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:42,660
V. So just like that more
complicated circuit that I'd

382
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,860
looked at, I ended up with a
straight line relationship in

383
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,990
the current voltage--

384
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,980
the relationship between the
current and voltage falls on a

385
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,990
straight line.

386
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,160
So how special is that?

387
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,770
Well it actually happens
pretty robustly.

388
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,990
Think about what would happen
if I had two parts, the

389
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,130
generically--

390
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,840
so I'm thinking about these
being generic boxes, inside

391
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,710
could be anything.

392
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,430
There could be a current source,
a voltage source, a

393
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,060
linear resistor, or some
other one-port.

394
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,590
So if I had a generic box here,
and a generic box here,

395
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,320
and I connected them in
parallel, under the condition

396
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,020
that each of the generic boxes
had a straight line

397
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,060
current-voltage relationship,
it's easy to argue that the

398
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,210
resulting relationship between
current and voltage for the

399
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,940
parallel combination is
also a straight line.

400
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,060
All you need to do is realize
that if you hook two things in

401
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,300
parallel, the parallel voltage
is the same as V1 and V2.

402
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,210
So all the voltages
are the same.

403
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,220
And the currents add.

404
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,270
So Ip, the current end of the
parallel combination is the

405
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,520
sum of the two I's.

406
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,860
So if you think about the
relationship between V1 and

407
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,730
I1, and the relationship between
V2 and I2, you could

408
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,760
derive the relationship
between Ip

409
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,020
and Vp by just adding.

410
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,710
V1 equals v2 equals Vp, that's
what we saw here.

411
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,650
And the current at the
bottom is the sum of

412
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,900
the other two currents.

413
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,170
So, in particular, if this was
a straight line, and that was

414
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,490
a straight line, the sum of
two straight lines is a

415
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,830
straight line, right?

416
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,090
If you add two straight lines,
you get a new straight line.

417
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,200
So what this shows is that if
you started with parts that

418
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,630
were themselves straight lines,
parallel combinations

419
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,960
would generate a new part with
another straight line.

420
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,390
Same sort of thing happens if
the two parts we're in series.

421
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,100
In series we would
have Iseries --

422
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,820
it's the same as
I1 equals I2--

423
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,300
so that's the equivalent of the
y-axes, where previously

424
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,660
we had equivalents
of the x-axes.

425
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:03,250
And now if both of these boxes
had linear I-V curves, I would

426
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,290
now add horizontally rather
than adding vertically.

427
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,840
But I have the same result.

428
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,470
If the two, individual one-ports
had linear I-V

429
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,280
curves, and if I add
horizontally, I'll get a new

430
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,750
linear I-V curve.

431
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:26,910
And in fact, if you start--

432
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,830
if you put any combination of
parts that have linear I-V

433
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:37,350
curves together to form
a new circuit--

434
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,470
a new one-port, the I-V curve
for that new one-port will be

435
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,280
a linear function.

436
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,530
And the way to see that, is to
think about linear equations.

437
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,570
Remember when we solve a
circuit, we have to have one

438
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,385
law for every element, Like
Ohm's Law-- it's V equals IR,

439
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:00,480
or voltage source is V equals
V0 or something like that--

440
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,970
we need one law for
every element.

441
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,570
And then we have KVL and KCL.

442
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,310
Well all of the-- if we start
with the assumption that each

443
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,210
component has a straight line
relationship between voltage

444
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,760
and current, which is true for
linear resistors, voltage

445
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,000
sources, and current sources.

446
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,020
Those equations that describe
those parts are what we call

447
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,270
linear equations.

448
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:33,570
Linear equation is an equation
where the function of the

449
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,760
unknowns is a quote --

450
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,950
linear function.

451
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,920
It has the form--

452
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,750
some constant times an unknown,
plus some other

453
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,140
constant times some other
unknown, plus, in principle,

454
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,310
any number of those.

455
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,923
But it has to be a linear
function, so you're not

456
00:30:49,923 --> 00:30:52,950
allowed to have things like
V-squared in there.

457
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,480
But if you think about things
like voltage sources and

458
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,130
current sources and Ohm's Law,
they don't have squares in

459
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,180
there, they're linear
equations.

460
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,000
And the idea then, when we're
solving for the I-V

461
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,810
relationship for this new
one-port thing, all we're

462
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,760
doing is we're solving a system
of linear equation.

463
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,820
Sort of in the abstract, the
idea is that we write down all

464
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,140
of the component equations
inside the box, we write down

465
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,570
all of the relevant KVL and
KCL, and then we solve.

466
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,570
So they're all going to have--

467
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,850
each one of those equations is
going to be linear, so it's

468
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:32,200
going to be something like, say,
a0x0 if x is my unknown.

469
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,270
'x' could be a current
or a voltage.

470
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,080
And then I might have sum of x1,
then I might have sum of

471
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,020
x2, and I might have a whole
bunch of things, and they all

472
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,790
add together to be some
constant, like that.

473
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,550
So that might represent
part one--

474
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,270
that might represent one of
the components in the box.

475
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,310
Then I would have another
component, which would be some

476
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,075
other linear equation.

477
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,930
Then I'd have a KCL equation,
well KCL is easy, because that

478
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,410
only has currents in it,
and the multipliers are

479
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,260
all 1 or minus 1.

480
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,670
Right, so that's
clearly linear.

481
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,300
And I have KVL equations.

482
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,840
Those are linear.

483
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,260
And the point is, that when you
solve linear equations,

484
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,240
you get a new linear equation.

485
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,200
So think about solving this by
the method of substitution.

486
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,060
I could figure out
what is x0 here.

487
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,860
If I use this equation
to figure out x0.

488
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,000
x0 would be a linear function
of all the other x's.

489
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,290
So then if I plug that linear
function into here, I replace

490
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,420
this linear equation with a new
linear equation with one

491
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,530
fewer unknown.

492
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,980
if I keep doing that, I just
keep replacing linear

493
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,780
equations with other
linear equations.

494
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,350
When I'm all done, I'm left with
a new linear equation.

495
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,030
That's why, if you start with
parts that linear I-V curves,

496
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,230
you'll end up with a straight
line I-V curve.

497
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,520
So that idea that the I-V
function is a straight line is

498
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,380
quite robust.

499
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,420
It will happen anytime you go
to circuit out of ideal

500
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,360
parts-- whereby ideal parts,
I mean Ohm's Law resistors,

501
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,190
voltage sources, and
current sources.

502
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,310
So that has a very interesting
circuit interpretation.

503
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:34,160
If I know that an arbitrary
circuit can be represented by

504
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,090
a straight line--

505
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,680
if the I-V curve can
be represented

506
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,350
by a straight line--

507
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,180
well that generates
an equivalent set.

508
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,160
There's obviously more than
one circuit that could

509
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,960
generate the same
straight line.

510
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,480
Here's a circuit that can
generate that straight line.

511
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,610
In fact, it will always be true
that I can generate a

512
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,870
circuit with one voltage source
and one Ohm's Law

513
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,130
resistor that will mimic the
behavior of any arbitrary

514
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,630
combination of resistors,
voltage

515
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,940
sources, and current sources.

516
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,850
All I need to do is think
about, you take the

517
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:17,170
complicated thing, figure out
its straight line plot, now

518
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:20,909
you read off some critical
numbers from this plot.

519
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:25,500
You say, OK, well what if
the current were 0?

520
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,630
Well if the current were
0, I'd be on this axis.

521
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:34,320
If the current were 0 in the
circuit, V would be V0.

522
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,110
So that means you look over
here, you figure out the

523
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,020
x-intercept, and the x-intercept
is the value of

524
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,270
the voltage source.

525
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:52,190
Similarly, if you figure out
the rate of growth of I --

526
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:57,240
so more generally, if you solve
for I, I will be the

527
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,110
difference between V and V0
divided by R, that's just

528
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,540
Ohm's law for the resistor.

529
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,580
And that then lets you figure
out the law for the slope.

530
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,710
The slope over here is going
to turn out to be one over

531
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,260
this resistor--

532
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,130
I should have had--
this should be R0,

533
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,530
these two should match.

534
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:22,170
So the slope of this line is
one over that resistor.

535
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,980
So in general, regardless of
how complicated the box is,

536
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,110
figure out the straight line and
I-V curves, read off the

537
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,070
x-axis, read off the slope, and
that lets you construct a

538
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,590
simple circuit that has
the same Vi curve.

539
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,390
We call that circuit the
Thevenin Equivalent.

540
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,470
What that means is, you can
think about a complicated

541
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,980
circuit, regardless of how many
parts, by a circuit it

542
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,270
just has two.

543
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:54,620
That's an abstraction that
lets us think more simply

544
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,230
about complicated circuits even
if there's no buffers.

545
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,990
This is true always.

546
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,650
OK, it's not true--

547
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,980
it's not it's not the case that
if I change the thing

548
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,460
that I put here--

549
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,550
if I change the thing I put
here, this relationship is

550
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,350
still true.

551
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:20,900
It's the equivalent of Ohm's Law
for complicated circuits.

552
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,010
Ohm's Law is what I get
if what's in the

553
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,050
box is a single resistor.

554
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,760
If what's in the box is
complicated, more generally

555
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,170
this is what I get, the
Thevenin Equivalent.

556
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,970
Of course there's lots
of circuits that

557
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,380
have this I-V curve.

558
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,320
So a different one is a current

559
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,490
source with a resistor.

560
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,570
That's called a Norton
Equivalent.

561
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,930
You do the same sort of thing.

562
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:52,190
What would happen if here,
if I set V to be 0?

563
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,030
Well how do I make V be 0?

564
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,980
I make V be 0 --

565
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,720
Did I write that on the slide?

566
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,520
no I didn't write
it on the slide.

567
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,480
I make V be 0 by putting
a short circuit here.

568
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,220
I connect a wire.

569
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,450
If I put a wire here, then
how big is the current I?

570
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,870
Well if I put a wire here, it's
easier for this current

571
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,300
to go through the wire
than it is to go

572
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,600
through that resistor.

573
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,580
So all of this current goes
through the wire.

574
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,800
All of this current is I0.

575
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,570
So if I put a short circuit
across V --

576
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:34,660
if I make V be 0,
how big is i?

577
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,430
Minus I0 right?

578
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,260
All the current I0
goes through, it

579
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,140
just goes to backwards.

580
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,400
So that's how I get
this point.

581
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,130
So if I wanted to replace some
complicated circuit with a

582
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,830
Norton Equivalent, I would take
the complicated system,

583
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:01,270
to figure out the I-V curve,
read off the intercept on this

584
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:07,030
axis, change the sign--

585
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,370
that's the most confusing
part, by the way.

586
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,840
This is the error that
you all make.

587
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,460
There's a minus sign in the
current relationship.

588
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,370
We like to draw-- it just makes
us feel good to have the

589
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:22,260
arrow go up.

590
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,420
And if you make the arrow
go up, it's in the wrong

591
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,710
direction to I. So when we did
the Thevenin equivalent, there

592
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,150
was no sign from it,
this was V0.

593
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,700
So the voltage on the voltage
source is equal to the

594
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,140
x-intercept.

595
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,015
But when we do the Norton, the
current in the current source

596
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:46,280
is minus the y-intercept.

597
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,650
Same idea, though.

598
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:48,250
OK?

599
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,590
So the idea is that Thevenin and
Norton equivalent circuits

600
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,150
are equivalent, in the
sense that they

601
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,200
generate the same voltage.

602
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,160
that the more complicated
circuit did.

603
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,060
So that means for thinking
about the circuit we can

604
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,580
ignore the complicated stuff,
and just know two numbers, V0

605
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,486
and R0, or I0 and R0.

606
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:21,060
So one more step, what this all
means is, that if you can

607
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,180
represent the current voltage
relationship for an arbitrary

608
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,120
circuit in terms of a straight
line, that means that when

609
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,820
we're trying to characterize
an arbitrary circuit, it

610
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,580
doesn't matter how complicated
it is.

611
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,480
It could have 100 parts in it.

612
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,830
Regardless of how complicated it
is, I only need to measure

613
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,060
two things in order to fully
characterize it.

614
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,870
If a circuit is made out of
linear resistors, voltage

615
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,600
sources, and current sources,
three special linear parts--

616
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,110
if a circuit is composed
entirely out of linear parts,

617
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,490
doesn't matter how many parts
are in it, there could 100,

618
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,130
there could be 1,000--

619
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,180
I only need to measure two
things to get a complete

620
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,610
description.

621
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,800
And that's because two points
determine a straight line.

622
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,820
I know, by having proved it by
using linear algebra, I know

623
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,330
by using linear algebra
that the solution

624
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,530
is a straight line.

625
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,840
I know from geometry
that two points

626
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,160
determine a straight line.

627
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,830
I only need to find
out two points.

628
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,250
So by convention, the easiest
two points is usually the

629
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,740
simplest cases.

630
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,530
Set the voltage to 0 and set
the current to be 0.

631
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,810
So that motivates the idea that
if I have an arbitrary

632
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,240
circuit, if I want to figure
out this reduced complexity

633
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,900
abstraction--

634
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,100
say I want to make a Thevenin
Equivalent--

635
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,460
what I would do is first to ask
the question, how big is

636
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,330
the open circuit voltage?

637
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,210
Open circuit means there's no

638
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,420
connection between the terminals.

639
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,380
That means the current is 0.

640
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,476
If the current is 0,
I'm on the x-axis.

641
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,610
So over here I'm on the x-axis,
so I'm thinking about

642
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:09,000
the red point.

643
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,830
Open circuit over here means
there's no connection here,

644
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,590
which means the current is 0,
and all I need to ask is--

645
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,960
regardless of how complicated
it is the circuit--

646
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,100
how big is the voltage that
I would measure here?

647
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,690
So in this circuit,
if I have a--

648
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,430
yeah, I confused myself
for a moment.

649
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:37,440
if this current is 0, then
this voltage drop is 0.

650
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,040
This voltage source prescribes
the voltage between these

651
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,930
nodes to be 1 Volt,
so V0 is 1 Volt.

652
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,710
So I just fell one point.

653
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,480
I set I to be 0, I found the
open circuit voltage.

654
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,440
Then I need to find one
other point, because I

655
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,740
only to find two.

656
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,590
So I'll find the short
circuit current.

657
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,540
Imagine that I put a wire
between the input and the

658
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,230
output, and I'll compute how
much current that circuit

659
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,870
generates in that wire.

660
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,640
Again the only confusing part
is that the reference

661
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,540
directions are backwards to
the way you might have

662
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,220
expected them to be.

663
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,020
If I put a short circuit here,
then the voltage between these

664
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,400
nodes is still 1 Volt.

665
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,540
That's what the voltage
source always says.

666
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,100
So the current that flows
through this wire, the short

667
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,160
circuit current, is just this V
over that R, except it's in

668
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,410
the negative direction.

669
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,320
And the way you can think about
that is that the slope

670
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,460
of this curve has
to be positive.

671
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,710
I need-- because of the
way Ohm's Law works--

672
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,780
increasing the voltage better
tends to increase the current,

673
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,090
because that's what Ohm's
Law resistors do.

674
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,230
So I need to have this slope be
positive if it's going to

675
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,720
be Ohm's Law.

676
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,350
So I characterize just those
two points, and then the

677
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,570
resistance is simply the
ratio of the two.

678
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,560
So the resistance is related
to the slope.

679
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,240
It's 1 over the slope,
you don't need

680
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,380
to worry about that.

681
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,250
The resistance is always V over
I, so you just take the

682
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,900
open circuit voltage and divide
by the short circuit

683
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,150
current, minus sign, and
you get that the

684
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,530
resistor must be 2 Ohms.

685
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,200
Is that all clear?

686
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,760
The idea is that we're trying
to build an abstraction that

687
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,000
lets us simplify the way we
think about circuits, without

688
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,250
introducing buffers.

689
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,900
So that means then that these
two circuits are equivalent to

690
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,110
that circuit, in the sense
that they all share

691
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,110
the same I-V curve.

692
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,640
If you substituted one server
for the other, you couldn't

693
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,230
tell from outside the red
box which was on the

694
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,970
inside of the red box.

695
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,830
OK so I'll do an example now.

696
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,050
Think about, what if I want
to find the equivalent--

697
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,620
the Thevenin equivalent
for this circuit.

698
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,200
I just do the things I
just told you to do.

699
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,910
First thing I think about
is, what's the

700
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,535
open circuit voltage?

701
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:14,740
So If I think about open
circuit, there's

702
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,290
no connection here.

703
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,430
That means this current is 0.

704
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,450
That means that the voltage
that develops

705
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,140
is the voltage divider.

706
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,670
So I get 7 and a 1/2 volts--

707
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,750
3 over (1 plus 3)
times 10, right.

708
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,660
So that gives me one point--

709
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,620
that tells me the voltage
source for the Thevenin

710
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,940
equivalent.

711
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,580
Then for the second point, I
want to think about the short

712
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,790
circuit current.

713
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,550
So I consider putting a wire
here, and then I compute the

714
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,990
amount of current that
flows in that wire.

715
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:54,610
And in this circuit, this wire
shorts out that resistor, so

716
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,180
all the current goes through
this wire, and none of the

717
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,720
current goes through
that resistor.

718
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,450
So that means that the total
current that flows is 10 Volts

719
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,870
divided by 1 Ohm, which
is 10 Amps.

720
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,190
And then I know that the
equivalent resistance is the

721
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,980
ratio of the open circuit
voltage to the short circuit

722
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,630
current, except I have to worry
about the minus sign.

723
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,190
And so I end up with the
equivalent resistance being

724
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,100
the 7.5 Volts, which is the open
circuit voltage, divided

725
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,760
by 10 Amps, so I get 7.5 Ohms.

726
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,280
And so the answer then, is that
here is the circuit I

727
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,970
started with, here's the
Thevenin equivalent circuit,

728
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,970
they're identical in the
sense that they have

729
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,390
the same I-V curve.

730
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,300
And you can just sort of see
why that has to be true.

731
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,020
If you think about, here's the
two circuits, and if you think

732
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,490
about the simple cases, if you
set I to be 0, the voltages

733
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,590
better be the same.

734
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,800
Well over here it's 7.5 by the
voltage divider, over here

735
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,155
it's 7.5 by the fact that
there's no current going

736
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:57,460
through that resistor.

737
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,050
And the short circuit current
better be the same.

738
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:02,080
So over here, if you short this
out, you're going to get

739
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,090
10 Amps, over here if you short
it out, you're going to

740
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,160
get 10 Amps.

741
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,550
So you can always go
back and forth.

742
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,680
The point is, that you can
substitute the simpler circuit

743
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,350
for the more complex circuit,
because they have

744
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,160
the same I-V curve.

745
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:21,120
OK, just to make sure that
you're following me, here's a

746
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,780
question that has to do with
taking the same circuit, but

747
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,950
considering the Thevenin
equivalent--

748
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,980
Thevenin or Norton
equivalent--

749
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,350
at three different ports.

750
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,300
Here I'm thinking about what
would happen if I looked in

751
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:41,380
terminal A, what if I looked
in terminal B, or looked in

752
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,640
terminal C?

753
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,540
Figure out the Thevenin and
Norton parameters, and see if

754
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,790
there's an error in the table.

755
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,213
So how many errors
are in the table?

756
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,890
About 50% correct again.

757
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:22,640
So which entry don't you like.

758
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,086
AUDIENCE: 2D?

759
00:52:27,086 --> 00:52:30,060
PROFESSOR: That's exactly
right, so 2D is wrong.

760
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,002
How do I figure out 1A?

761
00:52:32,002 --> 00:52:35,180
How do I figure out V0
for the a circuit?

762
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:43,600
So the definition of V0 is
the open circuit voltage.

763
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,220
So I need to figure out, for the
a circuit, how big would

764
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:51,770
be the voltage across A if there
was no current flowing

765
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,430
in the leg of A. Everybody
clear on that?

766
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,510
So the thing that I would do
is, I would think about,

767
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,470
there's no connection here.

768
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,440
What's the voltage here?

769
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,810
So how would I calculate that?

770
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,613
Yeah.

771
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:06,028
AUDIENCE: You would use the
current-divider relationship

772
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:10,616
to figure out that current
flowing through that is going

773
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:11,824
to be 4 Amps.

774
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:14,722
PROFESSOR: Precisely, so first
I need to take-- here are the

775
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:18,065
current sources, so I have two
resistor lengths, so that's a

776
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:21,240
perfect set up for the
current divider.

777
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,380
So the amount of current that
goes in this leg compared to

778
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,360
that leg is the ratio of this
resistance to the sum of

779
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,460
resistances, right?

780
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,020
And if you work that out, you're
going to get 4 Amps

781
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:37,550
coming through here.

782
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,870
So then after you know the
current through this leg, it's

783
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,700
an easy matter to take the
current and turn it into a

784
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,590
voltage, so the voltage at the
a port is 4 Amps times 5 Ohms

785
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,945
is 20 Volts.

786
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:51,195
Is that clear?

787
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,650
And similarly, but with a
different answer, the voltage

788
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,860
at the B terminal is the same 4
Amps, but now times 10 Ohms.

789
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,040
So that's how we got 40.

790
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,940
And at C, it's the same 4 Amps,
but now it's times the

791
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:12,150
sum, 4 times 15 is 60.

792
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,630
Everybody's happy about that?

793
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,330
So the point is that when you
generate an equivalent

794
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:22,610
circuit, it depends upon which
set of terminals you're using.

795
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,050
You can't just take a circuit
and say, give me the Thevenin

796
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:25,540
Equivalent.

797
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,040
You have to say, give
me the Thevenin

798
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,190
equivalent looking somewhere.

799
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,390
So I could look in the A port,
the B port, or the C port, and

800
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,850
I get different V0's.

801
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,100
How would I compute the I0?

802
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:45,182
Short circuit current--

803
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:49,370
so what I would do is I
would short this out.

804
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,543
When I do that, all the current
flows in this leg and

805
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:55,550
one of the current
flows that leg.

806
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,890
So that means I have,
equivalently, 10 Ohms in

807
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,440
parallel with 10 Ohms.

808
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,310
Then by the current divider,
how much current

809
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,230
goes down one leg?

810
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:07,480
Half of it.

811
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:14,380
I get a different answer over
here, because now I short out

812
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,660
that node, which shorts out that
resistor, so now I get a

813
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,530
different ratio of resistors.

814
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,880
It's not the same as the first,
so I know that this

815
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,640
answer can't be 5.

816
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,630
And, in fact, if you work it
out, the answer is 20 over 3.

817
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:38,140
And finally, if you short here,
then you know that that

818
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,600
short circuit shorts out
both this series

819
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,940
combination and that one.

820
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,270
So all of the 10 Amps goes
through that, so

821
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,790
you get that 10 Amps.

822
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,150
Then how do you get R0, which
is the ratio of V0 over I0.

823
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,560
So if you take V0 over
I0, you get 4.

824
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,460
Here if you do right answer, you
get 6, and here if you do

825
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,840
that you get 6.

826
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,380
The point is, that the Thevenin

827
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,680
equivalent you get is different.

828
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,320
The Norton equivalent that you
get is different, depending on

829
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,570
which ports you're looking at.

830
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,980
OK there's two reasons for
thinking about this.

831
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,820
One--

832
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,530
so why am I thinking about all
of these equivalent circuits?

833
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:28,120
So I wanted to have an
abstraction that was useful

834
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,950
for thinking about how
parts interact.

835
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,800
I wanted a way of thinking about
what would happen if I

836
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,300
changed the load on the circuit
without having to

837
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,920
recalculate all the voltages
and currents

838
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,100
throughout the circuit.

839
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,260
And so this Thevenin and
Norton idea is a

840
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,820
way of doing that.

841
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,290
That's important from a
practical sense, because when

842
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,660
you buy a part--

843
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,910
when you buy an electronic part,
they tell you how it

844
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,940
works by telling you the
Thevenin equivalent or the

845
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,150
Norton equivalent, or whatever
is the easy way

846
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:03,280
to think about it.

847
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,030
So there's a practical
reason--

848
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,970
when you buy an op-amp, they
tell you how good the op-amp

849
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,960
is by telling you how big is the
equivalent resistance at

850
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,370
the output.

851
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,470
So it has a practical value,
because it lets you-- it's the

852
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:19,020
way you specify an
electronic part.

853
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,910
You can't -- when the
manufacturer makes a part,

854
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:24,670
they can't know what you're
going to do with it.

855
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,180
So they tell you how it works by
telling you something about

856
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,030
the equivalent circuit.

857
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,480
There's also a different reason
for thinking about

858
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,110
this, and that is because it's
conceptually simplifying to

859
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:39,390
think about Thevenin and
Norton equivalents.

860
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,530
So here's an example that's
very much like the first

861
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,340
problem that I worked out.

862
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,670
What would be the effect
of closing this switch

863
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,770
on the current I?

864
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:51,990
We solved the problem very much
like this last time, and

865
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:55,170
one way you can solve it is you
figure out I in two cases,

866
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,190
when the switch is open and
when the switch is closed.

867
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,010
And you figure out whether went
up or down, and you know

868
00:57:59,010 --> 00:57:59,990
the answer.

869
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,910
The point is, that if you think
about this in terms of

870
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,380
equivalent circuits, it's
completely trivial.

871
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:08,730
If I think about what
would happen--

872
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:12,740
I'm interested in what happens
at I, what I do is split the

873
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,203
circuit into two pieces, the
stuff to the left of I, and

874
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:17,070
the stuff to the right to
of I. I make a Thevenin

875
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,500
equivalent for both of them,
and then I jam together the

876
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,780
two Thevenin equivalents.

877
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,230
What I get, in detail,
is showed here.

878
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:31,240
So if I look left, I see
a 20 Volt source with

879
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,070
a 4, 4, and a 2.

880
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,970
That has a Thevenin equivalent
that is showed here, which is

881
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:40,670
independent of the state
of the switch.

882
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,930
So the same Thevenin occurs on
the two sides, switch open, or

883
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,070
switch closed.

884
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,040
If i make a Thevenin over here,
there's no sources.

885
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,670
So it's just going to
be a resistance.

886
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,133
So when the switch is open,
I have to 2 Ohms, when the

887
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,383
switch is closed,
I have 1 Ohm.

888
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:03,620
I don't even need to figure out
what are these part values

889
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:07,490
to see that, if I make this
resistance smaller, which

890
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:12,096
happens if I close the switch,
the current goes up.

891
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:15,370
I mean it's true that I showed
here that the Thevenin voltage

892
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,370
is 10 and the Thevenin
resistor is 4.

893
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,720
I don't even care.

894
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,760
Regardless of what the
Thevenin voltage was,

895
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,800
regardless of what the Thevenin
current is, it's

896
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,270
going to be the same when the
switch is open and closed.

897
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,710
And that's a powerful
statement.

898
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:33,050
I know it's the same, so when
I close this which, all I've

899
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,990
really done is I've made
that resistor smaller.

900
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,620
The net series resistance is
down, the current is up.

901
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,610
So I have two reasons for
thinking about Thevenin and

902
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:44,290
Norton equivalence.

903
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:48,720
One is practical value, the
other is conceptual

904
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,760
simplicity.

905
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,440
It lets you simplify way you
think about a circuit, and

906
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,740
it's a way of gaining intuition
without ever even

907
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,310
solving the equations.

908
00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,120
Most circuit designers don't
solve certain equations.

909
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,020
They know what it's going to do
just by looking at it, and

910
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,150
this is the kind of reasoning
that they use.

911
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,310
OK, there's one more topic--

912
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:13,520
the idea of Thevenins and
Nortons really derived from

913
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,320
linear algebra.

914
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,730
The basic parts of most
interest are linear.

915
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,710
And when you put together a
system out of linear parts,

916
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,410
you get a linear system.

917
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:28,090
There's one more consequence of
linearity that is terribly

918
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:32,020
useful, and that's the idea
of super position.

919
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,000
If you have a system of
equations that is linear, and

920
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,710
if you have multiple sources,
things are very simple.

921
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,050
You can see that over here.

922
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,310
If I had multiple sources, the
system of equations that I get

923
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,540
wouldn't look quite like this.

924
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,720
These terms, the constant terms,
they're the ones that

925
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,810
come from the drives,
the voltage

926
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,120
sources, the current sources.

927
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,040
So if I had two drives, I would
get something else here.

928
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,790
I would get plus a at
N+1 for example--

929
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,650
source one, source two.

930
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:06,471
And I would get source
one, source two.

931
01:01:06,471 --> 01:01:10,850
So the idea is that, if I have
a system that has multiple

932
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:16,200
sources, I know from the
structure of the linear

933
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,846
equations, there is just
more constant terms.

934
01:01:20,846 --> 01:01:22,480
OK, well what's that mean?

935
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,720
That means you can just use
linear algebra to see that the

936
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,790
answer to this problem is the
sum of the answers to that

937
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,970
problem plus the answers
to that problem.

938
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:37,050
That's just linear algebra.

939
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:40,130
What that means in terms of
circuits is, I can figure out

940
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,640
the response to a circuit
by turning on the

941
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,590
sources one at a time.

942
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:47,360
That's called superposition.

943
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,440
And generally speaking, it's a
lot easier than solving the

944
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,630
circuit out the long way.

945
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:57,180
So here I've got two sources So
say I wanted to compute I,

946
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:01,040
in response to V0 and I0.

947
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:05,930
What I would do, is I would turn
off the I0 source, and

948
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,420
calculate the voltage
that results just

949
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,400
from the voltage source.

950
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,610
That's the same as setting
this to 0 and finding the

951
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:14,860
response to this.

952
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,820
So if I want to set I to 0, the
way you set I to be 0 is

953
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,790
open circuit.

954
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:29,160
If you open circuit something,
there's no current going to

955
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,410
flow through it.

956
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:34,960
So I replace the current source
with an open circuit,

957
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,860
and compute the i that would
be result when the current

958
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,970
source isn't there.

959
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,540
OK, well that's easy.

960
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,480
If their current source
we're not there, this

961
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,500
would be open circuit.

962
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,630
The current, i, would just be
the total voltage going

963
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,770
through R1 and R2.

964
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:56,890
So the answer, I1, the first
component of the current I,

965
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,840
would be V0, the result of the
voltage source divided by the

966
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,850
sum of R1 and R2.

967
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,840
Now that's not the
whole answer.

968
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,580
That would be the whole answer
if I0 weren't there.

969
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:11,280
So now I have to worry
about the other case.

970
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,810
What if only I0 were there?

971
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:16,860
Well now I have to
set V to be 0.

972
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,060
Well setting V to 0 is not
open circuiting it.

973
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,806
You can't just reach in, grab
the voltage source, and throw

974
01:03:22,806 --> 01:03:27,220
it away, because that'll
make the current 0.

975
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,900
If I want the voltage to be 0,
I have to short circuit it.

976
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:35,610
So what I do then, is I leave
the current source alone, and

977
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,030
I replace the voltage source
with a short circuit,

978
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:41,780
guaranteeing that V is 0.

979
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:46,160
Then I ask, how big is I2, the
component of I that results

980
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,730
from the current source?

981
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:52,680
Well if I've short circuited
this, then I just get a

982
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,200
current divider.

983
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,720
This current has to do with
how readily the current

984
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,030
divides between R1 and R2.

985
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:04,170
The amount that goes through the
R1 side is in proportion

986
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,670
to R2 make R2 bigger, more
of it goes through R1.

987
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,120
Standard current divider,
except for the

988
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,370
slippery minus sign.

989
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,960
So if I only had the current
source, the current I2 would

990
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,150
have been current divider
operating I0 with the slippery

991
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,280
minus sign.

992
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,770
So that means, by superposition,
that the result

993
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:29,475
of having both sources on is
just the sum of those answers.

994
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,570
That's a very big
simplification.

995
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,050
If you've got multiple sources
in the circuit, you can think

996
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,540
about them all at once.

997
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,410
And if you really good at
writing linear equations and

998
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:48,760
solving them with pencils,
you'll get the right answer.

999
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,820
But there's an enormous
simplification if you just

1000
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,950
turn off all but one, and
do them one at a time.

1001
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:57,680
So here's a problem.

1002
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,770
Here's a very simple
circuit, compute V

1003
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,940
by using super position.

1004
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,350
V is the voltage across
the resistor.

1005
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:07,420
How big would V be if you used
the idea of super position?

1006
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,040
So what's the answer?

1007
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:08,010
50% correct, roughly speaking.

1008
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:09,200
OK I want to use
superposition.

1009
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,580
So how big would the voltage
v be, if all I had was the

1010
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,910
voltage source?

1011
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:15,430
One.

1012
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,000
How big would the voltage
be if i only

1013
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,106
had the current source?

1014
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:21,510
Ah, got half of you.

1015
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:24,250
That explains the 50% correct.

1016
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,693
How big would the voltage
be, if I only

1017
01:07:25,693 --> 01:07:27,970
had the current source?

1018
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:29,560
It's tempting to say (1).

1019
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:34,390
I say tempting, because that's
the wrong answer.

1020
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:36,810
[LAUGHTER]

1021
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,530
What is wrong about
the answer (1)?

1022
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:44,464
What does the voltage do
to the current source?

1023
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:46,776
The voltage due to the current
source is the voltage that the

1024
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:48,020
current source would have
generated if the voltage

1025
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,730
source weren't there.

1026
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,335
If the voltage source weren't
there, then--

1027
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,050
half of you got it right,
so half of you

1028
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:58,300
can shout the answer.

1029
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,600
So if the voltage source weren't
there, the voltage

1030
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,920
source would be 0.

1031
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,920
If the voltage source were
0, then V would be 0.

1032
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,290
So if the voltage due to the
voltage source is 1, the

1033
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,910
voltage due to the current
source is 0.

1034
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,310
The sum of the two is 1.

1035
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,180
The answer is 1.

1036
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,899
OK?

1037
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:21,149
Make sense?

1038
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,689
So, very closely related
problem.

1039
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:28,510
What's the current I?

1040
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:29,760
Solve that by superposition.

1041
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:12,800
So how big is the current I
according to superposition?

1042
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,244
Wonderful, so how big is the
current i generated by the

1043
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:21,070
voltage source?

1044
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,892
1.

1045
01:10:22,892 --> 01:10:26,286
How big is the I generated
by the current source?

1046
01:10:26,286 --> 01:10:28,980
Negative 1, the sum is 0.

1047
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,990
All right, so those two problems
were trivial by

1048
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:31,395
superposition.

1049
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:33,840
They're not too hard by
non-superposition.

1050
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,280
But the point is, that they're
trivial by super position.

1051
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,220
So what we saw today--

1052
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,700
the goal for today was to
generate some abstractions

1053
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,730
that let you think about the way
parts interact with each

1054
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,480
other, because that's a central
issue when you're

1055
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,700
thinking about circuit design
And we built the idea of

1056
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,100
Thevenins and Nortons
and super positions.

1057
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,740
That was the basic idea.

1058
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,450
And the sub-theme--

1059
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:01,450
or maybe I should say the major
theme is really that.

1060
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,110
It's the importance
of linear algebra.

1061
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:07,610
So the take home message is
probably, take 18.06.

1062
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:11,250
So this was all about the
application of 18.06 to the

1063
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,230
solving of circuits.

1064
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:14,480
See you later.
