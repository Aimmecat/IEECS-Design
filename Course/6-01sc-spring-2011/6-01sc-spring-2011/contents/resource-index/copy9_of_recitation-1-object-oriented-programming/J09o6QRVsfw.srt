00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,320
PROFESSOR: Today I'd like to
talk to you about some

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,890
techniques that you can add to
basic search to enable your

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,510
systems to make more intelligent
decisions and save

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,380
computation time.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,710
Last time, we introduced basic
search and the basic idea of

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,150
how to encode search so that our
system can use search when

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,730
encountering an unknown
territory or state space.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,000
And today, we're going to review
some things you can do

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,110
in terms of using the
information that you know and

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,980
also using estimations of the
information that you would

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,510
like to know to improve your
chances of discovering the

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,040
path that you're interested
in the fastest.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,490
The first thing that we can do
in order to improve our search

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,540
is use dynamic programming.

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,510
Dynamic programming refers to
the idea is that once you've

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,080
done a computation for a
particular kind of problem,

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,640
you can save that computation
and use it later, as opposed

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,180
to having to engage in that
computation a second time.

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,020
The way this manifests in
search is that once you

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,970
visited a particular state, you
don't have to visit that

21
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,830
state again.

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,610
Because the way your agenda's
set up, you found the fastest

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,420
way to that particular state,
as far as you're concerned.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,930
So the general idea is that once
you visit a particular

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,920
state, you don't have
to visit it again.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,490
If you're building a normal
search tree, it can be

27
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,740
difficult to keep track of where
you've been, especially

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,060
if you're doing something like
that depth-first search.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,990
To get around this and to enable
dynamic programming,

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,020
the easiest thing to do is just
keep a list of the states

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,150
that you visited as a
consequence of this particular

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,210
run of search.

33
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,190
I'm going to demonstrate dynamic
programming by running

34
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,440
depth-first search on
our state transition

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,580
diagram from last time.

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,450
The first two steps are the
same, except for the fact that

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,640
we're going to keep track of the
fact that we visited both

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,400
A, B, and C as a consequence
of the first two

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,650
iterations of search.

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,720
If I'm running depth-first
search, my agenda acts as a

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,010
stack, which means I'm going to
take the partial path that

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,010
I added most recently to the
agenda, pop it off, and expand

43
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,270
the last node in the
partial path.

44
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:40,710
When I expand C, I'm going to
visit B and D. However, B is

45
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,390
already in my list of states
that I visited, because it's

46
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,700
already in one of the partial
paths in my agenda.

47
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,260
So I'm not going to
visit B again.

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,670
Instead, I'm only going to add
one new partial path to my

49
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,410
agenda, ACD.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,060
I'm also going to add D to my
list of visited states.

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,870
If I run another iteration
of depth-first

52
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,740
search, I find my goal.

53
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:29,040
For completeness, E is added
to list of visited states.

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,980
This took even fewer iterations
that the original

55
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,450
depth-first search.

56
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,480
We didn't waste time expanding
different nodes.

57
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,240
We also used less space.

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,240
In the general sense, the
concept of dynamic programming

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,730
is great to use whatever
you can.

60
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,730
And in search, it can save you
a lot of time and energy.

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,580
Another way we can intelligently
improve our

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,040
search technique is by making
considerations for costs that

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,100
we know that are associated with
particular transitions.

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,990
In this state transition
diagram, I've indicated some

65
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,100
costs associated with
the transitions

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,710
between particular states.

67
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,400
If we know the costs associated
with transitions,

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,339
then we can use a cumulation
of the weights accumulated

69
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,120
through traversing a particular
partial path to

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,500
prioritize which paths we're
going to explore first in an

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,890
effort to reduce the amount
of cost associated

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,120
with our final actions.

73
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,580
In order to do that, we can
keep track of the value

74
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,320
associated with that cumulation,
and sort the

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
agenda at every iteration
based on that cost.

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,580
If we're using dynamic
programming, while making

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,310
considerations for both cost and
heuristics, and also when

78
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,950
we're running the goal test when
making considerations for

79
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,050
cost and heuristics, we're
actually going to make our

80
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,470
considerations when we expand
the node as opposed to when we

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,930
visit the node.

82
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,010
This difference is very
important because it provides

83
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,110
us with the most optimal
solution.

84
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,650
If it's possible for us to visit
the goal node, but it's

85
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,860
100 cost units away, It may be
worth our while to search for

86
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,130
alternatives that provide
a much shorter

87
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,340
path to the goal node.

88
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,970
That's why we switch from
considering when we visit to

89
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,300
considering when we expand.

90
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,400
Let's look at uniform cost
search run with dynamic

91
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,724
programming.

92
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:39,540
In my first step, I expand
A and add two

93
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,080
partial paths to my queue.

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm also going to keep track
of the cumulative cost

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,410
associated with that
partial path.

96
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,310
When I expand A, I add
A to the agenda.

97
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,640
Note that I haven't talked
about stacks or queues or

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,070
depth first or bread
first or anything.

99
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,850
We're working with
a priority queue.

100
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,580
And what that means is that
things with a higher priority

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,240
float to the top.

102
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,970
Or things with the lowest cost
associated with them we're

103
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,720
going to consider first.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,210
This means that I'm going
to expand B in the

105
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,090
partial path AB first.

106
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,740
I'll add it to my list.

107
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:33,650
When I expand B, B has two child
nodes, D and C. ABC has

108
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,050
partial path cost 3 associated
with it.

109
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:42,440
And ABD has partial path cost
11 associated with it.

110
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,300
That means when I reprioritize
my queue, I'm going to end up

111
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:55,030
sorting everything such that
AC comes first, ABC come

112
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:03,340
second, And ABD comes third.

113
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,110
Previously, with our strategy
for dynamic programming, C

114
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,200
would not have been added to
this partial path, because

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,210
we've already visited
it with path AC.

116
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,290
At this step, we're going to
expand the path AC, add C to

117
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,410
the list, and any other time
that we end up visiting C, we

118
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,880
will not add it to our paths.

119
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,470
If I expand C, I have a
transition to B, which is

120
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,360
already in my list, and
a transition to D

121
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,610
that has cost 7.

122
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,370
ABC is going to float to the
top of my priority queue.

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,230
ACB is not going to be
considered, because B is

124
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,480
already part of my list.

125
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,300
And ABD is going to remain
with cost 11.

126
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,059
At this point, you might say,
but Kendra, why am I

127
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,350
considering partial path ABC
when C is in my list--

128
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,620
or C should be in my
list, excuse me--

129
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,650
as a consequence of expanding
the partial path AC?

130
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,510
Even though we've expanded the
partial path AC, if we have

131
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,410
not made any considerations to
weed out our list at every

132
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,320
iteration, this is still going
to float to the top.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,060
And we're still going to have
to deal with it, even though

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,110
we've already expanded C. Since
we've already expanded

135
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:07,340
C, we're going to ignore this
partial path and just move ACD

136
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,730
7 and ABD 11 up to the front.

137
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,870
D is not in our expanded list.

138
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:41,630
When we expand D, we have one
child node E. Because we're

139
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,280
working with cost and
heuristics, we do not actually

140
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,340
evaluate the goal test
when we visit a node.

141
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,870
We evaluate it when
we expand a node.

142
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,260
So I am going to add
ACDE to my agenda.

143
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,520
It's going to have cost 8.

144
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,160
And ABD11 is still going to hang
out here at the back of

145
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,410
the priority queue.

146
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:26,260
At this point, I get to expand
E. I skipped adding D to the

147
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:36,230
expanded list when I expanded
it from ACD to ACDE.

148
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,540
At this point, I'm going to
expand E. And the first thing

149
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,550
I'm going to do is test and see
whether or not it passes

150
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,060
the goal test.

151
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,430
At that point, I stop search,
return that I successfully

152
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,940
completed the search, and
that my partial path

153
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,190
is going to be ACDE.

154
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,420
That covers uniform
cost search.

155
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,390
At this point, you might say,
Kendra, this is bearing a lot

156
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,180
of similarity to things
like maps.

157
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,010
And I would really like to be
able to use my knowledge of

158
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,990
things like the Euclidean
in order to make more

159
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,910
intelligent, even more
intelligent decisions about

160
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,230
where it is that I
go with myself.

161
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,300
And I would say yes, you
should be able to.

162
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,130
In fact, people do.

163
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,640
In fact, people do
all the time.

164
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,610
They say well, some
thing's this far

165
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,700
away as the crow flies.

166
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,900
So I know that if I've gone
further than that at any

167
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,390
point, then I've wasted
some amount of time.

168
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,920
But it represents a good
underestimate of the distance

169
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,020
that I'm going to cover.

170
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,615
This is the basic concept
of heuristics.

171
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
If you're attempting to find a
goal, and you have an estimate

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,220
for the remaining cost, but
you know it's not exactly

173
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,910
right, you can still use that
information to attempt to save

174
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,110
you an amount of computation
or amount of search.

175
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,570
In particular, you probably
shouldn't be using a

176
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,240
heuristic, if you know
it's perfect.

177
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,590
Because if you know the
heuristic is perfect, then you

178
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,550
should be using the heuristic
to solve your problems,

179
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,410
instead of doing search
in the first place.

180
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,820
Or if the heuristic already
tells you how long it's going

181
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,680
to take to find something, then
it probably also has the

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,210
path that represents how
long or that represents

183
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,560
that amount of cost.

184
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,940
If you want to use a heuristic
effectively, you have to make

185
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,130
sure that your heuristic
represents a non-strict

186
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:48,040
underestimate of the amount
of cost that is left over.

187
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,160
And what do I mean by that?

188
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,470
I mean that if you have a
heuristic, and you're using it

189
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,720
as a thing to tell you whether
or not you're wasting your

190
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,830
time, if your heuristic
represents information that is

191
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:13,480
bogus or says this particular
path has more cost associated

192
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,460
with it than it actually does,
then it will lead you astray.

193
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,320
Or you don't want to use a
heuristic that will prevent

194
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,040
you from using a path that
actually costs less than the

195
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,990
heuristic advertises.

196
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,880
This is what's known as an
admissible heuristic.

197
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,910
An admissible heuristic always
underestimates if it makes an

198
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,900
error in estimation about your
total distance to the goal.

199
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,040
All right.

200
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,550
So at this point, I've covered
dynamic programming.

201
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,520
I've covered costs.

202
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,130
I've covered heuristics.

203
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,810
And it turns out, you
can use all of these

204
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,010
techniques at the same time.

205
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,800
When you use both cost and
heuristics, in combination,

206
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,010
while evaluating your priority
queue, that's known as an

207
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,910
A-Star search.

208
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,200
And you'll see a decent amount
of literature on A-Star.

209
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,100
This covers all of the
intelligent improvements to

210
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,610
basic search that I will talk
about in this course.

211
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,850
We hope you enjoyed 6.01.
