1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,510
PROFESSOR: Today I'd like to
talk to you about a new method

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,790
for solving circuits.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,520
Last time, we reviewed using
KVL, KCL, and Ohm's Law in

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,780
order to solve circuits
in a general sense.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,060
This produced a lot of
equations, in particular, a

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,530
lot of redundant equations or a
lot of dependent equations,

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,090
that we don't necessarily need
for solving our circuit.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,880
Today I'm going to review the
Node Voltage Component Current

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,135
method, which is very similar
to node analysis.

10
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,390
So if you hear one versus the
other, know that you're

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,030
talking about approximately
the same thing.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,960
And I'll review the difference
in a second.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,520
Once we know how to use the
NVCC method for solving

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,360
circuits, we can express the
relationships between

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,370
components in our circuit
more concisely and more

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,150
effectively, and possibly solve
our equations faster,

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,825
which is relevant when we're
working on a mid-term or in

18
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:54,680
the general sense, just
trying to save time.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,930
Let's take a look at NVCC.

20
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,370
As I said before NVCC,
stands for Node

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,940
Voltage Component Current.

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,990
And what that means is if you
have a very simple circuit--

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,690
let's say just a voltage source

24
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,940
and a couple of resistors.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,030
Previously, with KVL, we were
interested in the voltage drop

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,380
around the loop being
equivalent to 0.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,370
In this case, we're actually
going to look at the voltages

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,795
associated with particular
nodes.

29
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,030
To do that we're going to label
our nodes, which are

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,465
anywhere our components
connect.

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,740
We're also going to go after
the component current.

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,740
When we're doing KCL, we
typically look at the flow in

33
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,420
and out of a particular node.

34
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,820
At this point, we're going to
look at the flow through a

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,650
given component.

36
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,110
So we're also going to label all
of the currents associated

37
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,289
with our circuit.

38
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,370
But when we approach NVCC
method, we're going to think

39
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,020
about the currents flowing
through a particular component

40
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,100
as opposed to and out of
a particular node.

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,610
NVCC is sort of the opposite of
KVL and KCL in that sense,

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,490
even though you're still going
to end up using the same

43
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,740
relationships.

44
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,830
So at this point, I've labeled
the currents going through--

45
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,780
I labeled one individual current
for every component in

46
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,030
my circuit.

47
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,450
The next step would be to
identify what I'm going to

48
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,520
call ground, or in particular,
one of my nodes --

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,740
I'm going to assign to ground
or relative voltage 0.

50
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,600
At that point, I'm going to
write out the relationships

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,050
between the voltage drop across
particular components,

52
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,460
the current flowing through that
particular component, and

53
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:49,090
whatever relationship the
component requires the voltage

54
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,920
and the current to have
to one another.

55
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,340
That's a whirlwind review
of NVCC method.

56
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,870
Node analysis is very similar.

57
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,840
The main difference between node
analysis and NVCC method

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,720
is when your component
is a voltage source.

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,840
And there are multiple currents
flowing into that

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,500
voltage source.

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,870
You can treat this as
a single voltage.

62
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:24,330
You can treat this as a single
voltage node, where this

63
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,140
voltage it has value 0.

64
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:35,710
And actually write your KCL
equations as though this point

65
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,450
were collapsed.

66
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,010
So current flowing in and
current flowing out, or vice

67
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,580
versa, have to sum to 0.

68
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,470
That's the major difference.

69
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,720
Let's look at an example.

70
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,110
You can find this example
repeated in

71
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,680
6.4.3 of the reading.

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,940
And I'm going to walk through
these directions.

73
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,910
So the first thing I'm going
to do is label my

74
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,160
nodes and my currents.

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,330
People interchangeably
use e or n.

76
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,580
It doesn't really matter.

77
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,420
I guess n in particular could
refer to the node, while e in

78
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,580
particular could refer
to the voltage

79
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,830
associated with that node.

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,610
Now I'm going to specify the
voltage drop across a

81
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,720
particular component in terms
of the node voltages.

82
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,990
I'm also going to assign
n0 to 0 as my ground.

83
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,070
As a consequence, I know that
n1 is going to be 15 Volts.

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,290
My voltage drop is typically
specified in the same

85
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,800
direction as the current -
that I've also decided.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,710
So this convention
is arbitrary.

87
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,140
But if you want to be consistent
in your work, and

88
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,490
make it easier to get partial
credit or get help in office

89
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,570
hours, et cetera, then assume
that the voltage drop occurs

90
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,090
in the same direction
as the current.

91
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,800
That's it for our relationship
associated with voltage drop.

92
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,930
Now I'm going to go over KCL
for the relevant nodes.

93
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,660
And in the last step I'm going
to combine the two into the

94
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,280
equation that you're certainly
allowed to use to express your

95
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
work on midterms.

96
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,720
Or if you can skip
to the third step

97
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,540
immediately, then that's OK.

98
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,840
Just check your signs.

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,090
Here's the second step.

100
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,370
Flowing into n1 is i0 and
flowing out is i1.

101
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,410
So i0 is going to
be equal to i1.

102
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,040
Flowing into n2 is i1 and i3.

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,700
And flowing out of n2 is i2.

104
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,020
Flowing into n0 is i2,
and flowing out of

105
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,710
n0 is i0 and i3.

106
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,900
we're almost certainly
not going to end

107
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,810
up using that equation.

108
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,680
Because it's the last of our KCL
equations and is dependent

109
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,230
upon the other equations
that we've already

110
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,480
written out for KCL.

111
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,070
I3 is equal to 10 Amperes.

112
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,865
So we can go ahead and make
that substitution.

113
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,860
I still have to work with
i1 and i2 though.

114
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,320
And I can go after expressions
for them in terms of my node

115
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,980
voltages and components by
using the equations for

116
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,510
voltage drop I made earlier.

117
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,120
This is the equation that you
can jump straight to, if you

118
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,340
understand where this expression
comes from, as a

119
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,555
consequence, of our KCL and also
our component voltages.

120
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,030
I'm going to substitute in
15 Volts for n1 here.

121
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,710
And now I have an expression
that only contains n2 and

122
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,870
known values.

123
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,720
So I can solve for n2.

124
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,750
and I'll do that real
quickly right now.

125
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,360
So first I'm just going
to copy this over.

126
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,270
I'm going to multiply
through by 6 Ohms.

127
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,270
And I solved for the voltage
associated with n2.

128
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:34,180
At this point, I can solve
for i2 and i1.

129
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,290
Sorry about that.

130
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,730
What do I have left?

131
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,390
i3 I know is 10 Amperes.

132
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,015
i0 is equal to i1, which
is negative 1 Amperes.

133
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,660
There's a voltage drop
associated with the 3 Ohm

134
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:19,060
resistor, which is 15 minus
18, negative 3 Volts.

135
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,950
And the voltage drop associated
with the 2 Ohm

136
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,190
resistor is 18 Volts,
since n0 is ground.

137
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,860
This concludes my introduction
to node voltage component

138
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,470
current method or node analysis
without the ability

139
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,510
to collapse voltage
sources for KCL.
