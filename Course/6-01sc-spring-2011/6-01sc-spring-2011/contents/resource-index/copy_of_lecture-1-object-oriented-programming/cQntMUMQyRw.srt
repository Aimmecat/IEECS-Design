8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,020
PROFESSOR: Hello.

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,730
Welcome to the second
lecture in 6.01.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,350
I hope you had a good
time last week.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,700
Last lecture, we looked at
what is probably the most

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,680
important theme in this course,
which is, how do you

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,410
organize your thoughts, your
design, the things that you

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,720
do, in order to manage
complexity when you're trying

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,430
to build a complicated system?

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,720
The mantra for this
class is PCAP--

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,530
primitives, combinations,
abstractions, and patterns.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,350
And last time, we saw how at
the very most elementary

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:21,880
level, Python provides some
tools with which we can

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,320
achieve this goal of defining
primitives, combining them

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,220
into more complicated ideas,
abstracting the important

22
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,380
information, and generating and
capturing new patterns.

23
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,500
And so, for example, we saw
that Python has a defined

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,950
statement that lets you
associate a sequence of

25
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,070
operations with a name--

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,350
both of those things are
important, the sequence

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,560
represents a combination, the
name represents a way that we

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,980
can abstract the behavior of the
combination and treat it

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,340
as though it were primitive
operation.

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,360
We saw that we could do the same
sort of thing for data

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,030
structures.

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,590
And in particular, the list
structure in Python allows us

33
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,680
to generate hierarchical
heterogeneous structures in

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,710
much the same way.

35
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,700
Then variables allow us to
associate names with those

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,850
structures.

37
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,120
And finally, we saw that classes
allow us to combine

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,090
not only data, but also
procedures --

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,550
all into one object
of related things.

40
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,840
So that's PCAP at the most
primitive level.

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,730
What I want to do today
is talk about

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,210
PCAP at higher levels.

43
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,260
How do you build upon that
framework to continue this

44
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,120
idea of building with
abstraction and modularity?

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,400
How do you make--

46
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,230
how do you combine primitive
operations into powerful

47
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:56,860
operations?

48
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,830
How do you combine primitive
data into powerful data?

49
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,670
And what I want to do is think
about the next level above the

50
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,920
most rudimentary level
in Python.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,740
So we'll look first at some
programming styles, and how

52
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,990
that affects your ability to
define useful abstractions.

53
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,590
And then I'll look at something
much higher level,

54
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,840
which is state machines, which
is the way that we will think

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,740
about the construction
of robot controls.

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,120
So I'll start with just a few
words about how you--

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,620
the different ways that you
could structure a program.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,580
The reason for doing this is
that the basic structure that

59
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,080
you use can have an important
effect on

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,700
your ability to abstract.

61
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,050
We'll look at three different
methodologies for

62
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,420
constructing a program.

63
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,060
I'll refer to the first one as
imperative, also procedural.

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,370
That's kind of the most basic
way you could think about

65
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,220
writing a program.

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,940
It's kind of a recipe.

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,370
It's kind of like cooking
with a recipe.

68
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,710
Take this, add this, stir this,
bake for 30 minutes,

69
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,380
that kind of thing.

70
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,329
So if you define a procedure,
if you organize the way you

71
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,010
think about it in terms of step
by step instructions for,

72
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,070
what should I do next?

73
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,210
We refer to that kind of an
approach as imperative.

74
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,340
We'll look at functional
programming.

75
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,880
There, even though you implement
precisely the same

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,340
algorithm, the perspective is
a little bit different.

77
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,560
There, rather than focusing
quite so narrowly on the step

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,560
by step, how do you get from A
to B, the idea is going to be,

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,700
think about the structure of
the problem in terms of

80
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,890
functions in a mathematical
sense.

81
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,710
By which I mean, functions
that eat inputs, generate

82
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,980
outputs, and don't have
side effects.

83
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,450
Side effects are things like
setting variables that you can

84
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,700
later look at.

85
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,300
Then I'll look at
object-oriented programming.

86
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,990
Again, you could be implementing
precisely the

87
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,850
same algorithm by using an
object-oriented approach, but

88
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,500
here the focus will be on
building collections of data

89
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,650
with procedures that are
related, and organizing the

90
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,270
solution to your problem in
terms of a hierarchy of such

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,210
structures.

92
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,970
So what I'd like to start off
today with is to look at an

93
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,790
example problem and how you
could program it using any of

94
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,210
these three approaches.

95
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,400
So the example program is going
to be, find a sequence

96
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,230
of operations--

97
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,400
by which I mean, an operation
is either

98
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,650
increment or square--

99
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,990
the idea is that the operations
are things that we

100
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,080
will do to integers.

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Find a sequence of operations,
either increment or square,

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,060
that transforms one integer,
which is the initial value, i,

103
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,510
into a goal, which
I'll call, g.

104
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,990
So I want to think about
the problem of

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,890
finding such sequences.

106
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,130
So for example, the sequence
increment increment increment

107
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:26,090
square, when applied to
1, would give 16.

108
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,550
So I'm thinking about the first
increment increments 1

109
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,560
to give you 2.

110
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,840
The second increment increments
2 to give you 3.

111
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,080
The third increment increments
3 to give you 4.

112
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,290
Then square squares
4 to give you 16.

113
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,130
So I'll refer to this as having
found the sequence of

114
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,230
operations, increment increment
increment square,

115
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,380
that transforms 1 into 16.

116
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,820
Everybody with me?

117
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,650
OK, I'll be the judge of that.

118
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,770
So, to prove that you're with
me, what's the minimum length

119
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,590
sequence of increment and square
operations needed to

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,010
transform 1 into 100.

121
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,230
You've got thirty seconds to
discuss it with your neighbor,

122
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,810
come to an agreement, and I'm
gonna ask you to raise your

123
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,680
hands with a number of fingers,
(1), (2), (3), (4),

124
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
or (5), indicating
the right answer.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:08:14,900
[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION]

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,430
PROFESSOR: OK, everybody
raise your hand.

127
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,740
Tell me a number of fingers
equal to the right answer,

128
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,245
raise your hand, show me
a number of fingers.

129
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,310
OK, I'm seeing--

130
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,660
OK.

131
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,870
So keep in mind the number
of fingers is the

132
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,120
thing before the colon.

133
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,140
That avoids the awkward way
of saying less than 4.

134
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,940
OK?

135
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,860
So I want the number
before the colon.

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,429
So what is the minimum
length sequence?

137
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,380
Raise your hand, indicate
a number of fingers.

138
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,390
OK, the answers are improving.

139
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,420
Higher so I can see you.

140
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,020
OK, it's about 90%
correct, I think.

141
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,850
OK, most people said (3), which
is another name for 5.

142
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,100
OK.

143
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,160
So how do you get
the answer 5?

144
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,810
What's the answer?

145
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,146
Somebody explain that answer?

146
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:08,619
Yeah.

147
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:10,984
AUDIENCE: Increment increment
square increment square?

148
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,880
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly right.

149
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,060
So since I have two operators,
increments and squares, and

150
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,980
since I'm trying to cover a big
distance, 1 to 100, square

151
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,130
increases faster--

152
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,570
at least for bigger numbers,
than increment does.

153
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,730
So what you'd like to do is
figure out a way of coercing

154
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,380
as many squares as possible.

155
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,230
So a good thing to do is to
start at the end, and you can

156
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,990
take the square root of the
first one evenly, and that

157
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,950
gives you 10.

158
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,660
But then you can't take the
square root of 10, so you back

159
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,420
off and you get 9, and then you
can take the square root

160
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,170
of 9, et cetera.

161
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,550
So there's any number of ways
you could solve this problem,

162
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,780
the point is, that there's a
simple solution which is, the

163
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,920
answer (3), which is
a pseudonym for 5.

164
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,930
So 5 operations will get
you from 1 to 100.

165
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,480
So what I want to do now--

166
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,470
now that you know the answer
to the question, I want to

167
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,950
write a program to
find that answer.

168
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,660
The most straightforward
approach that you could use is

169
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,130
what we would call, imperative
or procedural.

170
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,600
The idea is to solve the problem
by walking your way

171
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,920
through it in some premeditated
fashion.

172
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,540
A reasonable premeditated
fashion would be, think about

173
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,610
the sequences and order
them by length.

174
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,120
Think about all the sequences
of length

175
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,630
one, see if they work.

176
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,975
Think about all the sequences
of length

177
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,210
two, see if they work.

178
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,620
Three, see if they work.

179
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,710
And just keep going until
you find one that works.

180
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,000
That's a very reasonable--

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,210
that's a procedure.

182
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,930
Start by thinking about short
sequences, and proceed by

183
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,470
making them longer and longer
until you run into one that

184
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,790
happens to solve your problem.

185
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,000
So that's what's
going on here.

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,940
First I gave a name to the
operator, increment.

187
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,230
Then I give a name to the
operator, square--

188
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,620
that's just for convenience.

189
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,140
Then what I want to do
is write a program--

190
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,790
find sequence, that will start
at some initial value, say 1,

191
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,090
and go to some goal, say 100.

192
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,890
And the way I'll do that is to
enumerate over the lengths of

193
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,180
sequences that are possible --

194
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,430
1, 2, 3, et cetera.

195
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,080
I'll represent each one of those
sequences of operations

196
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,790
by this kind of a
representation, I'll make a

197
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,200
tuple that has a string
that tells me in

198
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,970
English, what did I do?

199
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,470
And an integer that tells
me what the answer is

200
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,530
after I've done that.

201
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,320
So looking ahead, this is the
idea-- this is the program

202
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,460
that I'm trying to construct.

203
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,790
I would like the output of the
program to start by thinking

204
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,340
about all sequences of length
one, then sequences of length

205
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,890
two, then sequences of length
three, then sequences of

206
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,140
length four.

207
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,160
For each sequence of length one,
I'd like to think about,

208
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,640
what are all the possible
sequences?

209
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,490
Well, I could start with 1 and
increment it to get 2.

210
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,980
Or I could start with 1 and
I could square it to 1.

211
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,790
That's all the possible
sequences of length one.

212
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,480
Then I go on to length two,
three, four, by the time I'm

213
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,430
down here to length four, I
could start with 1, increment

214
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,050
square square increment, and
that would give me 17.

215
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,410
That's the structure
of the program that

216
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,480
I'm trying to make.

217
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,730
Everybody with it?

218
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,120
So I'm going to define find
sequence, I'm going to loop

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,370
over all those lengths, I'm
going to keep track of all the

220
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,070
different sequences I found
as a list of tuples.

221
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,510
After last week you're
supposed to be very

222
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,880
comfortable with those
kinds of words.

223
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,700
Each one of the sequences is a
tuple, a string and a final

224
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,420
value, and the list is
all possibilities.

225
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,550
And I'm going to try the ones of
length one, then I'm going

226
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,790
to append to each one to make
sequences of two, and then I

227
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,440
gonna append to that to make
sequences of three, four,

228
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,060
five, and keep on going.

229
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,450
So the point is, that this is a
very simple-minded, easy to

230
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,610
conceive recipe for how to
search through a large number

231
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,650
of sequences and find the one
with the minimum length.

232
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,170
So when you write that program,
it iterates down

233
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,550
until it finds number 5, the
5-length sequence here it came

234
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,170
up with the answer 100,
so that's the answer.

235
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,090
The point is, that it was an
easy way to write the program.

236
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,310
We just think about telling
somebody with a pencil and

237
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,680
paper, what would you do?

238
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,320
And we tell Python, rather than
the person with the piece

239
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,760
of paper, what to do.

240
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,580
The approach is straightforward.

241
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,560
The only ugliness is that
it ended up with

242
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,230
three levels of loops.

243
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,610
And the most common kind of
error in this kind of

244
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,330
programming is you just
botch the indices.

245
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,370
Because it's got three nested
layers of loops, it's very

246
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,120
easy to lose track --
when you're thinking

247
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,880
of layer three --

248
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,470
about what's happening
in layer two.

249
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,190
So that's the only difficulty
in this approach.

250
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,920
The challenge is just to keep
all the indices consistent.

251
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,540
But it works.

252
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,200
There's nothing wrong
with this approach.

253
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,380
It doesn't necessarily lead to
the most modular designs, but

254
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,370
you can write functional
programs that work this way.

255
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,730
A different way to structure the
program, I'll refer it--

256
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,180
here's a different version of
the same program, the same

257
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,910
algorithm, but I'm going
to refer to this one as

258
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,740
functional program.

259
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,850
Here the idea is to focus on
procedures that implement

260
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,230
functions of a mathematical
type.

261
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,310
I want to recast the problem,
this time thinking about, how

262
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,480
would I divide it up
into functions

263
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,780
that calculate things.

264
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,030
So rather than focusing on,
what's the set of nested loops

265
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,980
that I have to make, I want
to ask, what would be a

266
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,710
meaningful calculation that
I would want to do

267
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,710
to solve this problem?

268
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,140
So the first thing I might do,
focusing on this part, I might

269
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,960
write a function, apply,
where apply --

270
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,180
I'm using the methodology of
functional programming --

271
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,120
apply is a pure function.

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,780
It's going to eat some inputs,
generate an output, and have

273
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,510
no side effects.

274
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,660
So what I want it to do, I
want to feed it a list of

275
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,570
functions and ask it,
what's the answer?

276
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,640
So apply is going to have as its
first argument a list, but

277
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,490
the list is going to be
a list of operations.

278
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,120
It's not a list of strings, it's
not a list of integers,

279
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,340
it's a list of functions.

280
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,730
And what the procedure apply is
going to do is step through

281
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,160
that list, applying
the functions

282
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,815
one by one to argument.

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
So the final goal is
written down here.

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:27,180
If I apply nothing to 7, the
answer ought to be 7.

285
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,450
If I apply increment to 7,
the answer ought to be 8.

286
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,560
If I apply square to 7, the
answer ought to be 49.

287
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,580
And if I apply increment
square to 7, the

288
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,830
answer ought to be 64.

289
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,280
There's a couple things you're
supposed to see here.

290
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,140
First off, apply is
a pure function,

291
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,460
it has no side effects.

292
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,180
It eats its input, it does a
calculation, it tells you an

293
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,060
answer, and it's done.

294
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,690
There's no extra things that's
going on behind your back,

295
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,690
it's not setting a variable, or
creating a list, or doing

296
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,000
anything like that.

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,440
It has inputs, from those inputs
it generates an output,

298
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,690
and that's the end
of the story.

299
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,079
Another thing that you should
see is that I'm treating

300
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,819
procedures as first-class
objects.

301
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,270
That's another tenet of
functional programming.

302
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:23,020
Rather than sending the input
to apply as a list of text

303
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,440
strings, or as a list of
integers, I'm giving it a list

304
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,590
of function names.

305
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,990
I'm treating functions just
as though it were any

306
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,980
other kind of data.

307
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm making a list of functions
just the same as I could make

308
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,490
a list of integers, or if I made
a list of strings, I'm

309
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,310
just making a list
of functions.

310
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,300
So another important feature
of this program is the idea

311
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,560
that the functions
are being treated

312
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,570
as first-class objects.

313
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,580
The next procedure
is addLevel.

314
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,090
addLevel is going to be a
second pure function.

315
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,170
The idea there is that I'm
going to use addLevel to

316
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,780
construct all the different
sequences of operations that

317
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,820
are possible.

318
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,910
Each sequence is going to be
a list, so the entire--

319
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,290
all possible sequences will
be a list of lists.

320
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,190
So the idea in addLevel was
going to be that you take the

321
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:33,320
list of lists and you generate
from that list of lists a new

322
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,930
list of lists that has
one more element.

323
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,900
So if the first list of lists
had four elements in it, how

324
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,735
many lists are in the second
list of lists?

325
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,630
Five.

326
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,400
Four, five?

327
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,390
The first list of lists
represents some number of

328
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,600
different sequence
of operations.

329
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,550
My second list of lists-- what
I want to do is think about

330
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,790
all the different ways that
could be extended from a

331
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,370
length-4 sequence to a
length-5 sequence.

332
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,090
How many ways can you extend
a length-4 sequence to a

333
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,340
length-5 sequence?

334
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,540
Eight.

335
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,080
So four becomes eight.

336
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,645
Why does four become eight?

337
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,020
AUDIENCE: You've got like
two possibilities.

338
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,580
PROFESSOR: Because there's two
possibilities for the way that

339
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,590
you could extend it.

340
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,260
I could extend the length-4
sequence by adding on an

341
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,850
increment operator, or I could
extend it by adding on a

342
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,380
square operator.

343
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,060
So every time I addLevel, it's
going to create a new list of

344
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,000
lists with double as many
elements in it as

345
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,755
the old list of lists.

346
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:49,800
Does that make sense?

347
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,330
Other than that, the program
works very much the same--

348
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,410
I should illustrate that.

349
00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:00,170
So addLevel applied to the
list of lists, increment.

350
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:06,340
I'm only considering one
sequence of length-1, so how

351
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,090
many ways can I change that if
I'm willing to add procedures

352
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,290
increment or square?

353
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,170
Well, I could end up with
increment increment by taking

354
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,250
that one and that one.

355
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,680
Or I could end up with increment
square by taking

356
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,980
that one and that one.

357
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:27,580
So if I were to extend the
sequence, increment, two

358
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,200
possible ways, by either
incrementing again or by

359
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,890
squaring again, I end up with
two possibilities represented

360
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,082
by this list of two
different lists.

361
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,650
Is that clear?

362
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,980
The important point is that I'm
treating functions as any

363
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,835
other kind of data element that
could be added to a list.

364
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,180
And when you run that program,
you get an answer that's very

365
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,180
similar to the program that we
looked at previously, the

366
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,430
imperative program.

367
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:11,470
Except that the answer now
is a list of functions.

368
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,530
So rather than generating a
text-string like the previous

369
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,280
example did, this program
generates a list as the

370
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,260
answer-- the program generates
a list, which

371
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,300
is a list of functions.

372
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,110
The first element in the list
is increment, the second

373
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,880
element in the list is the
function increment, the third

374
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,540
element is square increment
square.

375
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,450
So it gave you the same answer,
it just represented it

376
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,690
differently.

377
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,605
Here I'm representing the answer
as a list of functions.

378
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,430
That make sense?

379
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,630
So there's a number of
advantages to this approach.

380
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,260
One of them is that it kind of
automatically coerces you to

381
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,975
think about modules.

382
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,590
By specifically focusing my
attention on, how could I

383
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,220
break up that problem by
defining functions?

384
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,010
I end up with a bunch
of functions

385
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,730
here, apply and addLevel.

386
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,835
And being functions,
they're modules.

387
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:16,810
They are things that are easy
to manipulate in other

388
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,430
contexts, and in particular,
it's very easy to debug them.

389
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,000
Especially in an interpretive
environment like Python.

390
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,220
It's very easy to figure out
if your program works by

391
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,330
figuring out if each
module works.

392
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,400
That's one of the important
features of modular

393
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:37,910
programming.

394
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,770
When you have a module, it means
that you can use that

395
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,790
module in multiple
different ways.

396
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,520
It's easy to break apart the
debugging problem so that

397
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,200
rather than trying to debug
the one, monolithic

398
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,030
structure--

399
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,990
which was the procedural program
that we wrote in the

400
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,720
first part, here we can debug
the individual components,

401
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,630
which happen to be functions.

402
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,380
So I can ask, what happens
when I apply the

403
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,700
empty list to 7?

404
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,460
Well, my answer better be 7.

405
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,080
So that provides a
way of checking.

406
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,430
So one of the features of
thinking about the algorithm

407
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,300
as being broken up into a number
of functions is the

408
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,520
greater modularity that
allows you, for

409
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,060
example, easier debugging.

410
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,810
A much more important reason for
thinking this way though,

411
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,800
is the clarity of thought.

412
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,480
And that can be derived from
another feature of the

413
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,210
definition of apply.

414
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,950
The particular way I
defined apply is

415
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,280
what we call recursive.

416
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,910
It's recursive in the sense that
the definition of apply

417
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,780
calls apply.

418
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,530
OK, that sounds like
a bad idea, right?

419
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,010
How do I define something
in terms of itself?

420
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,570
The idea is that each
application, every time apply

421
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,930
calls itself--

422
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,650
the idea is to structure the
procedure so that the new

423
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,070
incarnation is in some sense,
simpler than the previous one.

424
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,800
If you can guarantee that, it
will reduce the complexity of

425
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,370
the problem from something that
you don't know how to

426
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,890
solve, to something that you
do know how to solve.

427
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,010
And for that reason, it
represents a powerful way to

428
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,320
think about structuring
programs.

429
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,570
So as an example of that--

430
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,510
as an example of structuring
programs as recursions, think

431
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,880
about raising a number to a
non-negative integer power.

432
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:01,780
So if I'm trying to raise b to
the n, if n is 0, and if n is

433
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:07,280
a non-negative integer-- well,
if n is 0, b to the n is 1.

434
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,830
And if n is a non-negative
integer, then b to the n can

435
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,740
be reduced to b times b
to the (n minus 1).

436
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,300
Rewriting that functionally, if
I say that my function b to

437
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,120
the n can be represented
by f of n.

438
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,630
This statement is precisely
equivalent to saying that f of

439
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:34,060
n is 1, if n is 0, or b times
f of (n minus 1) if n is

440
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,130
bigger than 0.

441
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,204
So the idea then, is that I may
not know how to raise 2 to

442
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:45,780
the 10th, but I can use the rule
to say 2 to the 10th, oh,

443
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,030
that must be 2 times
2 to the 9th.

444
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,100
Great, I don't know how to
do 2 to the 9th, either.

445
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,020
But 2 to the 9th is 2
times 2 to the 8th.

446
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,580
And eventually, I boil it down
to a case that I do know the

447
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,450
answer to, in particular,
b to the 0 is 1.

448
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,750
I would express that idea in
Python this way, define

449
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,160
exponent of b, n.

450
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,356
If n is 0, return 1, otherwise
return b times exponent of b,

451
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:14,606
(n minus 1).

452
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,080
OK, so what that does then
when you invoke it--

453
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,910
invoking exponent of 2, 6, in
fact, invokes exponent an

454
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,820
additional six times.

455
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,680
If I ask Python to evaluate
exponent of 2, 6 it will end

456
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,690
up calling exponent of 2, 5.

457
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,130
But to evaluate that, it will
call exponent of 2, 4--

458
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,150
3, 2, 1, 0.

459
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,320
Then finally, it gets
to the base case.

460
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,890
When it gets to the call
exponent of 2, 0 it falls into

461
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,840
this case which returns
1 always.

462
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,380
So now exponent of 2, 0 returns
1, but then that can

463
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,050
pick up where call exponent
of 2, 1 left off.

464
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,630
When I did 2, 1 it fell into
this case, where it was trying

465
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,050
to take 2 times exponent of
2, 0 Now it knows the

466
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,620
answer to 2, 0 is 1.

467
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,340
So I can multiply by 2 and get
the answer is 2, and it backs

468
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,900
out then all of the
other answers.

469
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,800
So that's an example of how I
could use recursion to reduce

470
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,220
a complicated case to a base
case-- a simple case that I

471
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,750
know the answer to.

472
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,500
Here, the recruitment with the
power of n causes a linear

473
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,940
increase in the number of
invocations, so we would call

474
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,480
that a linear process.

475
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,050
So the idea then is that
recursion is a good way to

476
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:02,490
reduce a complicated problem
to a simpler problem.

477
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,830
Now that algorithm wasn't
particularly fast.

478
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,510
If I imagine doing a big
number like 1024.

479
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,680
Raising a number to the 1024
power, that could take awhile.

480
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,031
How long will it take?

481
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,510
1024 is going to-- it will make
1024 calls to reduce it

482
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,200
to the base case.

483
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,650
Here's a way I could
speed it up.

484
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,430
Here I'm trying to make
something called fast

485
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,580
exponentiation, where I'm going
to take advantage of

486
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,050
another rule for the way
exponentiation works.

487
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,059
Not only is it true that I can
write b to the n as b times b

488
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,820
to the n minus 1, but if n
happens to be even, there's

489
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:50,070
another rule that I can use.

490
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,600
If b is even, then I can raise
b to the n over 2, and square

491
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,080
the answer.

492
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,700
OK, that's more knowledge about
the way exponents work.

493
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,210
The point is, that when I
think about the problem

494
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,610
recursively, when I think
about the problem as a

495
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,520
function, there's a natural way
to take advantage of that

496
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,170
additional information.

497
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,180
So what I can do then is
implement in Python in a

498
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,850
scheme that looks very similar
to the one that I used for the

499
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,380
simple exponentiation,
but it has a new

500
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,060
rule embedded in there.

501
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,830
So I can say, if n is 0 --

502
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,340
that was my original base
case, if n is 0

503
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,800
the answer is 1.

504
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,250
If the modulus of n when divided
by 2 is 1, if it's

505
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,420
odd, use the old rule--

506
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,470
which says b times the exponent
of b, n minus 1.

507
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,390
However, if it's neither 0 nor
odd, then use this new rule.

508
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,890
If I use that procedure compared
to the previous

509
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:07,820
program, exponent, how many
invocations of fastExponent is

510
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,330
generated by a call to
fastExponent of 2, 10?

511
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,810
So talk to your neighbor,
figure out an

512
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,310
answer, raise your hand.

513
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,350
Use the number before the dot,
just to keep you alert.

514
00:30:21,350 --> 00:31:47,504
[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION]

515
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:52,010
PROFESSOR: So how many
invocations of fastExponent is

516
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,410
generated when you call it
with the arguments 2, 10?

517
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,355
Everybody raise your hand, tell
me a number of fingers.

518
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,470
OK, it's about 90%, something
like that.

519
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,860
The most common answer is five,
how did you get five?

520
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,550
So do you think of reducing
fastExponent of 2, 10?

521
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,800
What happens the first call?

522
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,684
AUDIENCE: It goes to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

523
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:30,080
divided by 2 is 5.

524
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,490
PROFESSOR: So the first thing
that happens, is that it

525
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,090
realizes that the 10 is even,
so the 10 is not 0, it's not

526
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,390
odd, it goes into this case.

527
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,300
So it tries to run it with 5.

528
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,660
Then when it tries to
run fastExponent

529
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,910
with 5, what happens?

530
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,510
OK, so 5 is not 0, so it's
not the base case.

531
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:00,480
It is odd, so 5 gets
reduced to 4.

532
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,010
4 gets reduced to 2.

533
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,190
2 gets reduced to--

534
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,420
et cetera.

535
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:13,360
So the idea is that we get a
faster convergence because,

536
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,500
just like in the very first
example we did, we can do two

537
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,940
different kinds of
operations--

538
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,420
either decrement, or in this
case half, and half works

539
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,140
faster when the numbers are
bigger than decrement does, so

540
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,020
it's the same idea as in
that first program.

541
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,010
So the idea, then, is that this
requires 5 where we would

542
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:39,240
have expected in the previous
exponent procedure, it would

543
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,940
have required 10.

544
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,880
And that difference just gets
bigger and bigger as we make n

545
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,130
bigger and bigger.

546
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,090
Much more importantly though,
than the fact that we can make

547
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:58,630
something fast, is the idea
that this is expressive.

548
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,510
The idea is that by structuring
the program this

549
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,430
way, it was perfectly obvious
how to incorporate more

550
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:10,449
knowledge about the way
exponents work.

551
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:19,330
I could have done it by using
a procedural approach.

552
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,840
Do this, then do this,
then do this.

553
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,030
But then I have very complicated
indices.

554
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,280
Check if it's-- check if it's
squared, check if it's

555
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,210
whatever, and it's inside
the loop, right?

556
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,750
So I complicate my looping
structure, where here--

557
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,230
because I'm using the functional
approach, it's very

558
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,340
easy to understand that it just
introduces another case.

559
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,530
It's nothing complicated.

560
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,909
So it's much more important--
the reason we think about

561
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,250
recursion isn't so much that
it's fast, it's because it's

562
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,290
expressive.

563
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,510
It's a way to incorporate
knowledge about an answer into

564
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,699
a solution, and that's
what we'd like to do.

565
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,020
We want to have a way of making

566
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,310
complicated things simply.

567
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:05,600
Here's a way to incorporate
knowledge about a procedure in

568
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,070
a very straightforward
fashion.

569
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,870
All we have is a second case.

570
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,240
Rather than making the loops
more complicated, all we have

571
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,060
is a simple new case
in this statement.

572
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,490
And that's especially important
when you think about

573
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,320
harder problems.

574
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,340
Here is a much harder problem.

575
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,070
So Tower of Hanoi, you
probably played

576
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,290
with this as a kid.

577
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,080
I want to transfer all the disks
from Post A to Post B--

578
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,650
I have a typo on your
handout, by the way.

579
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,680
I typed C on the handout,
and then I wrote the

580
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,730
program the other way.

581
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,090
That should have been a B.

582
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,840
Transfer a stack of disks from
Post A to Post B by moving the

583
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,300
disks one at a time, never
placing a bigger disk on top

584
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,550
of a smaller disk.

585
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,650
OK, that's kind of a challenging
problem.

586
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,620
It's a very challenging
problem if you try to

587
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,590
structure it as loops.

588
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,300
If you try to structure it as
loops I would recommend that

589
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,080
you do this gazillions of
times until you get the

590
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,970
pattern stuck in your
head, because the

591
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,220
pattern's not obvious.

592
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,620
But the pattern is obvious
if you think

593
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,870
about it as a recursion.

594
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,040
I don't know how to move n from
Post A to Post B. How

595
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,850
about this algorithm, take the
top n minus 1, move those to

596
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,790
C-- get them out of the way.

597
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,760
I don't know how you're going to
do that, but just trust me,

598
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,500
just do it.

599
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,450
So move n minus 1 of them off
the top, put them over on C,

600
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,160
that exposes the bottom one.

601
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,390
Move the bottom one to
B, which is where

602
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,200
I'd like it to be.

603
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,230
And then by this mysterious
process of moving n minus 1,

604
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,586
bring the n minus 1 back from
C back on top of B.

605
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:50,190
OK, what did I just do?

606
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,310
I just started with a
problem that I don't

607
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,310
know the answer to.

608
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:59,040
How do I move n disks from
this post to that post?

609
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,420
And I broke it into a sequence
of three operations, two of

610
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,790
which I don't know how to do,
but one of which I know.

611
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,670
The one will fortuitously
be the base case--

612
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,320
or at least similar
to the base case.

613
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,720
So the idea is, if I want to
transfer the n, do two

614
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,470
versions of the n minus 1
problem and glue them together

615
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,060
with this middle step.

616
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,810
OK, well I don't know how to
do the n minus 1 problem

617
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,730
either, just recurse.

618
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,700
How do I do the n minus 1 one?

619
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,270
Well, I'll do the
n minus 2 one.

620
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,210
I don't know how to
do that either.

621
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,040
Well, then do the
n minus 3 one.

622
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,670
Keep going until I
get it down to 1.

623
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,810
Because when I get down to 1,
I do know how to move 1.

624
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,200
Does that make sense?

625
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,670
This is supposed to illustrate
that the power of recursion is

626
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,240
in thinking.

627
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,840
Some algorithms are easy to
describe recursively.

628
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,340
That set, is the set when the
hard problem can be reduced to

629
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,280
a problem of the same type that
is in some sense simpler.

630
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,320
Here simpler means taking the
index n, and turning it

631
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,070
into n minus 1.

632
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,610
If you write this simple little
Python snippet and run

633
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,420
it, you get this procedure.

634
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,660
And if you--

635
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,650
so the procedure means, take the
top disk off A, put it on

636
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,860
B. Take the top disk off A, put
it on C. Take the top disk

637
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,190
off B, put it on C.

638
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,190
If you do that procedure, it
will magically do exactly the

639
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,900
right thing.

640
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,290
If you try to see the pattern
here, so that you were to

641
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:47,120
write this in a procedural
approach, the pattern is very

642
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,990
peculiar, but the algorithm for
doing it is very simple.

643
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,980
So the idea--

644
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,910
one of the reasons that we like
recursion, is this idea

645
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,170
of expressability.

646
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,860
It makes it easy to express
what we're trying to do.

647
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:09,850
OK, so that's a quick view of
the first two ways to do the

648
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,220
first problem that
I talked about.

649
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,530
We started thinking about a
sequence of operations, either

650
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,010
increment or square,
that transforms an

651
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,260
integer i into g.

652
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,380
The first thing we looked at
was a procedural approach

653
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,750
where I just gave
you a recipe--

654
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,250
do this, do this, do this.

655
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,280
The issue there is that I ended
up with nested loops

656
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,430
three deep.

657
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,490
The issue there is keeping track
of the indices for all

658
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,240
of the different loops.

659
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,900
We just talked about a
functional approach.

660
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:42,030
That can have an advantage,
especially whenever the

661
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,450
functional approach has a very
simple implementation.

662
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,780
The last approach I want to
talk about very briefly is

663
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,870
object-oriented approach.

664
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,490
Here--

665
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,450
I'm doing the same problem
again, find the sequence of

666
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,210
operations that transforms
i into g, 1 into 100.

667
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,740
Here I'm doing the same
algorithm again.

668
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,500
I mean, I haven't really changed
the algorithm in going

669
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,260
from the procedural approach to
the functional approach, to

670
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,010
here, the object-oriented
approach.

671
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,770
I have changed the
representation of the program,

672
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,200
and that's the point.

673
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,780
Here the representation
of the program

674
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,480
is in terms of objects.

675
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,080
Here what I'm going to do is
think about organizing all the

676
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,750
sequences of operations that
are possible in a tree.

677
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,180
So the sequences that I could
do, I could do no operation

678
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,100
followed by increment
increment increment.

679
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,580
Or I could do nothing increment
increment square.

680
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,610
Or I could do nothing square
increment square.

681
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,880
So I'm thinking about all the
possible sequences, but this

682
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,780
time, I'm not thinking about it
is a text-string, I'm not

683
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,670
thinking about it as a list of
functions that I need to call.

684
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:56,740
I'm thinking about it as this
tree, this tree of objects.

685
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,350
And in the object-oriented
approach, what I'm going to do

686
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:04,290
is think about the solution in
terms of building up the tree

687
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,530
until I find the answer.

688
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,250
So the key in the
object-oriented approach is to

689
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,355
think of a useful object.

690
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:18,050
What would I like to remember
when I'm constructing the

691
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,460
solution as this
kind of a tree?

692
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:29,770
Well, if I call every circle a
node, I can define a class

693
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,750
that will keep track of
all the important

694
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,940
things about each node.

695
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,790
And then I can structure my
program as creating nodes,

696
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,560
connecting them up into
that tree, and

697
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,260
looking for the answer.

698
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,685
So each one of these nodes,
each one of these circles,

699
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:57,220
ought to have a parent, they
ought to have an action, and

700
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,500
they ought to have an answer.

701
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,160
So, for example, let's say
that I started with the

702
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,750
initial value i equals 1.

703
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,930
Then this node right here
might say, whatever your

704
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,580
answer was at this point,
the answer here was 1.

705
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,210
So the answer here is going
to be 1 after it's been

706
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,070
incremented, so answer
should be 2.

707
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,845
So associated with each
one of these nodes is

708
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:24,880
going to be a parent.

709
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,300
The parent of this guy is this
guy, the parent of this guy is

710
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,730
this guy, the parent of
this guy is that guy.

711
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,710
Associated with each node is
going to be an action.

712
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,090
When I'm here, my action
is to increment.

713
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,210
When I'm here, my action
is to square.

714
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,600
And associated with each node
is going to be the answer.

715
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,420
So if I started at 1, by the
time I get here, the answer's

716
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:51,025
going to be 2, 4, 16.

717
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,050
So the idea is that I'm
structuring the

718
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,870
problem as a tree.

719
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,570
Each node has a couple things it
wants to remember, it wants

720
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,260
to know who it's parent was.

721
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,060
It wants to know, what's
the operation

722
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,840
associated with this node?

723
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,190
And it wants to know the
answer at this node.

724
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,220
Also associated with each
node, a method.

725
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,220
And the method will be to print
out the answer if this

726
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,150
node is the answer.

727
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:25,010
So the print routine is going to
have to say, OK, I ended up

728
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,760
here and that happens
to be the answer.

729
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Well, how did I get here?

730
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,610
Well, I have a parent, who has
a parent, who has a parent,

731
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,020
who is none.

732
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,960
So this routine is supposed to
figure out the sequence of

733
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,500
operations that led me from the
initial value up at the

734
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,655
top to the final answer that
just happens to be goal.

735
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,980
Is that clear?

736
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,720
So then I structure the program
in terms of building

737
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,540
those node structures.

738
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,390
I start off by making a node,
which is the top node.

739
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,570
It has no parent, it has no
action, and the answer to the

740
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,570
top node is 1.

741
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,510
And then I just think through
loops that are very similar to

742
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,750
the loops that I was
using before.

743
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,260
They're structured similarly
to the way they were

744
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,460
structured in the case of the
imperative program, except now

745
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,420
the iterations are generating
new nodes.

746
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,320
The iterations are simpler,
because each one just

747
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,210
generates a node.

748
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,540
It's not like in the imperative
case where I

749
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,110
treated separately, what was
the ASCII string that

750
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,100
represented the answer,
and what was

751
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,460
the cumulative answer?

752
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,240
Here I don't have two pieces
of things that I need to do

753
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,660
inside my loop, I just
make a node.

754
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,930
So the idea is that when I solve
the problem using this

755
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,200
approach, what I'm trying to do
is build a representation

756
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,680
for the solution out
of pieces that make

757
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,930
sense for this problem.

758
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,970
So the important idea that I
want to get across was to

759
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,410
think about modularity at
the next higher level.

760
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,620
We started last time with
modularity at the most

761
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,310
microscopic level in Python,
and we saw how Python had

762
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,800
primitives that allowed us
to build more complicated

763
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,850
structures and simplified
our task of

764
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,690
understanding complex designs.

765
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,270
We looked at the most
primitive level

766
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,730
in the first lecture.

767
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,970
What I just went over was how
even within the structure of

768
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,400
Python, you can structure
programs that are

769
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,370
more or less modular.

770
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,270
And the important point is that
the way you structure the

771
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:49,050
program influences the degree
of modularity that you get.

772
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,220
So the structure of the program
has a significant

773
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,450
effect on how modular
your solution is.

774
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,080
What I want to do for the rest
of the time today is jump one

775
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,540
higher level yet.

776
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,790
So last time, primitives
within Python.

777
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:15,970
First half of this hour,
imperative programming,

778
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,410
functional programming,
object-oriented programming,

779
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,420
approaches that affect the
modularity of your solution.

780
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,620
Now I want to go up one more
level and think about

781
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,630
abstraction and modularity
at a much higher level.

782
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,820
And there, I'm going to think
about programs that control

783
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,830
the evolution of processes.

784
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,580
What's a process?

785
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,710
A process is some set
of procedures

786
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,620
that evolve over time.

787
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,890
An example was a bank account.

788
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,180
OK, with the problems that we've
been thinking about so

789
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,910
far, there was a clear answer.

790
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,195
What's the minimum-length
sequence

791
00:46:51,195 --> 00:46:52,470
that blah, blah, blah.

792
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,700
Right?

793
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,640
There was a clear answer
to that problem.

794
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,200
Here there isn't a clear answer
to the problem, what's

795
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,020
the answer to the
bank account?

796
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,710
The bank represents a process,
it's something that

797
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:05,980
changes with time.

798
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,560
There are transactions.

799
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,070
Every time you make a deposit
or a withdrawal, you do a

800
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:16,170
transaction that causes some
action to happen in the bank.

801
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,260
So there isn't an answer,
there's an evolving answer.

802
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,890
So those are the kinds
of problems I want

803
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,070
to think about now.

804
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,020
Graphical user interfaces.

805
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,760
Again, there's no
answer to Excel.

806
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,740
Right, you can't say calculate
the answer to Excel.

807
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,240
Because whatever--

808
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,590
so the right answer for Excel
depends on, what's the

809
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,490
sequence of buttons that you're
pressing, and what's

810
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,510
the sequence of pull-down menus
that you're doing, and

811
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,340
all that sort of stuff.

812
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,010
So graphical user interfaces
are processes.

813
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,010
They're things that
evolve over time.

814
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,400
So they take a sequence of
inputs, and they generate a

815
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,540
sequence of outputs, just
like a bank does.

816
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,430
Controllers.

817
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,950
How do you make a
robotic steerer?

818
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,810
That's a process.

819
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:04,900
There are inputs--

820
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,130
so for example, where are you
in the middle of the lane?

821
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,640
What time is it?

822
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,760
How many pedestrians are
you about to hit?

823
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,490
There's all of those
kinds of inputs.

824
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:14,540
And then there is things
that you output--

825
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,480
which is like, keep going.

826
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,545
So some of the steering rules
are particularly simple.

827
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:23,520
Other steering rules are you
know, avoid the guy this--

828
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,450
well, anyway.

829
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:29,590
So the idea is that when you
were controlling processes,

830
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,790
we're going to want to think
about other kinds of

831
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:34,310
programming structures.

832
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:37,070
And even though the programming
structures are

833
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,600
going to be different, we're
still going to want to have

834
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,630
this idea of modularity.

835
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,230
We're going to want to be able
to think about, what are the

836
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,440
primitives that we have, how can
we combine them, what are

837
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,050
the important abstractions,
and how

838
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,390
do we capture patterns?

839
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,620
We're still going to
want to do PCAP.

840
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,430
But we're going to want to do
PCAP at a much higher level.

841
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:02,390
And the programming module that
I want to introduce is

842
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,900
the idea of a state machine.

843
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,410
A state machine is a very
convenient structure to

844
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,930
capture the behavior
of a process.

845
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:15,520
A state machine has an input,
a state, and an output.

846
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,330
The idea is that
it's a process.

847
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,830
It's operated upon in steps.

848
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,170
Every step there's
a new input.

849
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,540
From that input, the state
machine can calculate an

850
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:32,440
output and the next state.

851
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,380
By keeping track of the state,
this state machine can

852
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,620
remember everything it needs
to know so that it can

853
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,620
continue the process
into the future.

854
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,370
So the idea is that this
is going to represent a

855
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:49,740
fundamental programming element,
that we'll be able to

856
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,060
use to construct things that
are like processes.

857
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,270
And in particular, we use this
to represent the calculations

858
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,120
that are done within
our robot.

859
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,060
We'll think about the robot
as being a process.

860
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,580
It's not got an answer, you
can't ask the question, what's

861
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,570
the answer, to the robot.

862
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,580
But you can answer the question,
if I were trying to

863
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:17,510
steer and the sonar said
(x,y,z), how fast should you

864
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,970
turn the wheels?

865
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,130
You can think about that
as a state machine.

866
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,140
There's some state
of the robot.

867
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,610
There are some inputs--

868
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:26,850
which is what the sonars are
currently telling us, and

869
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,860
there's some output--

870
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,050
which is how fast we're
driving the wheels.

871
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,160
So we want to think about this
kind of a representation for

872
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,440
processes that evolve
over time.

873
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,000
OK, here's a very simple
example, a turnstile.

874
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,830
So we can think about the
turnstile as a state machine.

875
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,550
The turnstile has two states--

876
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,940
think about getting
onto the T--

877
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:58,160
either it's locked, or
it's not locked.

878
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,760
Those are the two states
of the turnstile.

879
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,910
There are some inputs.

880
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:11,610
The inputs are, I put a coin
in it, or I walk through it

881
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:17,700
and the turnstile turns,
or I don't do anything.

882
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,360
And based on those inputs, and
based on the current state,

883
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,060
the turnstile has
some outputs.

884
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,800
So the turnstile can either
allow you to enter,

885
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,940
or ask you to pay.

886
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:36,250
So the output might be an LED
sign that says, please enter.

887
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,130
Or it could have an LED sign
that says, please pay.

888
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,870
So those are out all of the
elements of a state machine.

889
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,390
And so we can think about a
graphical representation for

890
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,560
the turnstile in terms
of states.

891
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,640
Here I'm representing the
states as circles.

892
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,790
There are two states in the
turnstile, the turnstiles is

893
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,680
either locked or unlocked.

894
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,500
You move between states
by getting inputs.

895
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,910
So the inputs are represented
by the arcs--

896
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:14,010
it's the top identifier on each
arc is the input, the

897
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:18,580
bottom identifier is the output,
and the special arrow

898
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,400
says I start here.

899
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,020
So the turnstiles start out
locked in the morning--

900
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,210
the turnstile is locked.

901
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,780
If you drop a coin in it, you'll
move into the unlocked

902
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,150
state and it will
output enter.

903
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,390
It will tell you that it's OK to
enter because you've put a

904
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,960
coin in it now.

905
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,170
Then as long as you stay there
and do nothing, it'll continue

906
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,020
to say enter--

907
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,550
none enter.

908
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,360
Or if you keep dropping coins
in it, it'll say hey, keep

909
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,040
going, and it'll continue to eat
your coins and continue to

910
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,760
say enter--

911
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,820
being very nice.

912
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,310
So in those cases it remains
unlocked, it continues to tell

913
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:04,690
you that you can enter, and that
state persists until you

914
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,850
turn the turnstile.

915
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,470
When you turn the turnstile,
this particular turnstile

916
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:17,040
forgets how many coins you gave
it and it simply locks

917
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,450
and it tells you you've
got to pay more.

918
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,165
So the idea is that we can
capture the desired behavior

919
00:53:24,165 --> 00:53:26,490
of the turnstile--

920
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,750
the turnstile is a process,
it's a thing that

921
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,990
evolves over time.

922
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,390
But we can capture the essence
of what we would like the

923
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:37,290
turnstile to do in terms
of this diagram.

924
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:40,810
We'll call this a
state diagram.

925
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:46,810
And then we can think about
behaviors in terms of a set of

926
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:49,630
outputs as a function of time.

927
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,030
So imagine that as a
function of time--

928
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:57,090
say I started in the
state locked, and

929
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,520
the input is nothing.

930
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,090
So you wake up in the morning,
you go to the T, overnight the

931
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,100
turnstiles have all
been locked.

932
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,030
They all say that they're
locked, they all say, pay, as

933
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,150
their output.

934
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,420
If I don't do anything it just
sits there and it says pay.

935
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,750
If I drop a coin, it says enter
and it moves into the

936
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,020
unlocked state.

937
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,830
If I don't do anything
enter persists

938
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,050
and it stays unlocked.

939
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,820
If I walk through it, it eats
the coin and it says, OK, you

940
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,120
gotta pay now, and it locks.

941
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,900
So you can think about the
evolution of this process--

942
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,960
the evolution of the turnstile
in terms of the diagram with

943
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,210
regard to time.

944
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:49,820
And the idea then is that this
is a kind of a representation

945
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,240
that allows us to succinctly
capture the important

946
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,710
information about how
processes work.

947
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,120
One of the important features of
this representation is that

948
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,690
it removes you one level away
from the looping structure.

949
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,710
Somewhere somebody's keeping
track of the loop.

950
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,760
Something's going from time 0 to
time 1, to time 2, to 3 --

951
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,000
we'll talk about that later.

952
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,360
But for the time being, this
representation focuses on what

953
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,070
do you do at each instance
in time?

954
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:29,090
So it's a way of tearing apart
the time part from the state

955
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,800
transition part.

956
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,590
So separate out the loop from
the essence, it's very much

957
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:39,230
like the functional example
that I did.

958
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:42,240
The functions divorce themselves
from the looping

959
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,690
structure that we saw in the
imperative approach, and you

960
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,250
could define the functions
independent of the looping.

961
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,640
We're doing the same
thing here.

962
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,130
We can define the state
machine representation

963
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,280
independent of the looping.

964
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,840
And most importantly,
this idea of

965
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,090
state machines is modular.

966
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,420
Let me show you how that
plays out when we

967
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,340
think about the robot.

968
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,620
Think about the problem that I
showed you last time where

969
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:14,500
we're trying to have the robot
go from point A to point B.

970
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,900
Where, for example, it knows
where it is -- say it has GPS

971
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,260
or something.

972
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,230
It knows--

973
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:26,630
from a map say, where it wants
to be, but it has no idea of

974
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:31,310
the obstacles between where it
is and where it wants to be.

975
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,610
So we can think about that kind
of a problem-- we looked

976
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,350
at this last time.

977
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,940
It takes a step, it
uses its sonars--

978
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,640
which are depicted by these
lines, to infer that there are

979
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,020
some walls--

980
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,670
that's the black dots.

981
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,660
So it gets a reflection off the
sonar that tells it that

982
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,100
there's some obstacle
in the way.

983
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,600
That means it's not a good
idea to try to plow

984
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,310
straightforward, so if I back
up, the original plan, it had

985
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:59,600
no idea what was between it and
its destination, so its

986
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,370
plan was just buzz
straight through.

987
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,490
At the end of its first step, it
has got back sonar reports

988
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,090
that tell it that there's a wall
here, and here, and here,

989
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,700
and here, and here, and here.

990
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,270
And based on where the wall is,
and the size of the robot,

991
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,280
it can't get into any of
these red squares.

992
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,550
It's too big.

993
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,980
So it knows its original path,
which went from here to here,

994
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,820
isn't going to work because
it can't fit through.

995
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:36,990
So it computes a new path,
and then repeat.

996
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,620
So the idea is that
we're solving a

997
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,470
very complicated problem--

998
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,680
the robot 's solving a very
complicated problem, and what

999
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,710
I'd like to do now is
think through a

1000
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,290
solution to that problem.

1001
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:53,840
As the robot's moving along,
on every step it's getting

1002
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,740
some new input--

1003
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,530
it's behaving just like
a state machine.

1004
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,850
On every step it gets new
input from the sonars.

1005
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,500
Based on that new
input, it knows

1006
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,380
where there's new obstacles.

1007
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,550
Based on that knowledge,
it has a better idea of

1008
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,140
what the map is.

1009
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,970
Based on that knowledge, it has
a better idea of finding a

1010
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,810
plan that might work.

1011
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,310
And then based on that
knowledge, it knows how to

1012
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,810
tell the wheels to
move forward.

1013
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,695
So think about where
it is right now.

1014
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,880
It has done, logically, three
different things.

1015
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,270
It has figured out where
the walls are.

1016
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,940
That's the thing represented
in black and red.

1017
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,545
We'll call that --
it made a map.

1018
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,760
Given the map, it
made a plan--

1019
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,010
that's the blue thing.

1020
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:51,180
Given the plan, it figured out
how to turn the wheels.

1021
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,820
It's going straight ahead.

1022
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:57,690
So there are logically three
things going on,

1023
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,200
all at the same time.

1024
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,320
You can imagine writing an
imperative program to capture

1025
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:06,930
that behavior, but that's
complicated.

1026
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:09,100
Not impossible, you
would structure it

1027
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,375
as a bunch of loops.

1028
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:12,520
You know, it would--

1029
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,840
unless you're a crack
programmer, and

1030
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,646
I'm sure you are--

1031
00:59:15,646 --> 00:59:17,920
it will end up being
an ugly program.

1032
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,660
The idea is, that by using the
state machine representation

1033
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,640
we'll be able to think
about how to pull

1034
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,920
apart those three pieces.

1035
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:34,130
So in particular, we can think
about the state machine for

1036
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,010
the robot--

1037
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,030
which would take the sensory
input from the sonars and turn

1038
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:41,670
it into an action, which
is turning the wheels--

1039
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,320
we can think about that as
having three modules.

1040
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,020
There's the mapmaker module,
which just looks at the

1041
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,250
sensory input.

1042
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,910
Doesn't care what the plan is,
doesn't care how it's turning

1043
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:54,030
the wheels right now.

1044
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,590
All it the cares about
is, what was the --

1045
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:59,070
what's my current state?

1046
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,660
And what new information
can I infer about the

1047
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,540
map from the sonars?

1048
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:08,180
So given the sonars and my
current state, what's the most

1049
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:12,620
recent version of the map
likely to look like.

1050
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,820
Then there's a planner that
says, given the sonars and the

1051
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:21,360
map, how would I construct
this blue line?

1052
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,180
Given my current understanding
of the map of the world, how

1053
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,130
would I get from where I am,
to where I want to be?

1054
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,430
That's a plan.

1055
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,170
Then from that plan--

1056
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:38,850
say the robot is here, from the
plan you can see that the

1057
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,180
thing the robot should do
is move straight ahead.

1058
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:47,200
So the mover can take
the heading--

1059
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,130
the heading is just simply the
coordinates of the first

1060
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,980
destination point in the plan.

1061
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,100
So the mover can look at the
heading, the first destination

1062
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,100
point, and figure out how
to make the wheels turn.

1063
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,970
So the idea is that the state
machine representation will

1064
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,920
let us parse a very complicated
problem.

1065
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,460
A process--

1066
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:11,200
the process by which the robot
gets from here to there, a

1067
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,590
very complicated process.

1068
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:16,140
We're going to be able to
break it up into pieces.

1069
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,030
The pieces are going
to be much easier.

1070
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:20,750
They're going to be modular.

1071
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:25,180
We will be able to write this
piece, and debug it and make

1072
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,330
sure that it all works,
independent

1073
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,760
of these other pieces.

1074
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,930
Because we just have it do any
arbitrary walk around task or

1075
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:36,790
no walk around at all and ask
whether the set of sensory

1076
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:40,880
inputs generates the
correct map.

1077
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,930
Similarly, this will
be a module.

1078
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:45,920
This will be something that we
can debug as well without

1079
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,590
having the other
pieces working.

1080
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,930
We'll be able to say, OK, well,
what if I fed a map that

1081
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,770
I hand constructed
to the robot--

1082
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,160
ignore this, just forget
this, assume

1083
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,590
there is none of these--

1084
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,340
I can hand make a map, feed it
to this guy, give it sensory

1085
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,890
input and see if it comes up
with the right heading.

1086
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:08,020
It's just like in that
functional approach example

1087
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,290
that I did.

1088
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,230
Having made the individual
functions, we were able to

1089
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:15,670
test them individually because
they were modules.

1090
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,680
Having made these individual
state machines, we'll be able

1091
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,320
to test them individually
because they're modules.

1092
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,090
Then at the end we'll be able to
paste them all together and

1093
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,830
get a very complicated
behavior--

1094
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,980
much more complicated than you
would expect from the sum of

1095
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,680
the three programming
activities.

1096
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,690
That's what we want.

1097
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,960
That's how we want to
structure things.

1098
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,470
We want to be able to combine
simple things and get

1099
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,950
something that seems more
powerful than the linear

1100
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,565
combination, because it is.

1101
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,840
Okay, so that's the goal.

1102
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,900
To do that, we're going to
invent some new Python

1103
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,610
structures.

1104
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,450
And we're going to think about
the representation of the

1105
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:59,050
state machine in Python and
we will use objects.

1106
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:03,020
In fact, we use objects
at three levels.

1107
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,200
We'll think about the highest
level of abstraction of this

1108
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,490
problem as a state machine.

1109
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,490
So there's going to be
state machine class.

1110
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,620
The state machine class is going
to have all the things

1111
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:18,100
in it that all state machines
have to know about.

1112
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,970
All state machines, as we define
them, are going to have

1113
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:28,300
to know how to start, how to
make one step, and how to

1114
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,960
combine single steps into a
sequence of steps-- and we'll

1115
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,490
call that operation
of transduction.

1116
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:39,070
So if you give me a list of
inputs, transduce will make a

1117
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:41,120
list of outputs.

1118
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,370
So all state machines are
going to be able to--

1119
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:46,580
all state machines are going to
have to know how to start,

1120
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,710
step, and transduce.

1121
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:52,390
Then for particular types
of state machines--

1122
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:56,310
like the turnstile, we will
generate a subclass.

1123
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,730
The subclass of turnstiles are
going to have to know-- all of

1124
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,280
those are going to have to
do some other things.

1125
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,180
All turnstiles are going to have
to have a rule for what

1126
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,250
happens when you're in state
A and you get input i--

1127
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,840
what should you do?

1128
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,820
Well there's going to be a
general pattern that all

1129
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,380
turnstiles will subscribe to.

1130
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,880
We'll put those in the
subclass, turnstile.

1131
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,450
Then individual turnstiles.

1132
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,700
The first one in the Kendall
stop, the second one in the

1133
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,010
Kendall stop, the first one in
the Central stop, the third

1134
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,820
one in the Harvard stop--

1135
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,250
particular turnstiles
will be instances of

1136
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:40,390
the turnstile class.

1137
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:43,770
So the way this plays out, we'll
have a generic state

1138
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:47,500
machine class defined here.

1139
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,750
The state machine class will
have a method, start.

1140
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:56,240
Start will create the instance
variable, state.

1141
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,490
Every instance of a turnstile
has to remember where it is,

1142
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:02,510
that's an instance variable.

1143
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:05,360
That instance variable gets
created by the start routine.

1144
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,890
So the very first thing you do
if you want to talk about a

1145
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:12,400
new turnstile, is you have to
instantiate the turnstile.

1146
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,580
Then you have to make
an instance--

1147
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,960
and you do that by
calling start.

1148
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,160
Every state machine has to
have a start routine.

1149
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,040
Every start routine will do
this-- it'll create an

1150
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,940
instance variable.

1151
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:31,100
Every state machine has to
know how to take a step.

1152
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:38,100
We will make a generic method
called, getNextValues, which

1153
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:44,980
will include all of the rules
for how the class turnstile

1154
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:52,020
generates a new output, and a
new state from the implant.

1155
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:57,180
And every subclass of state
machine will have to define

1156
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,140
what one of those looks like.

1157
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:04,370
The important thing here is that
every state machine has

1158
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:08,100
to have a step routine, and
the way we've decided to

1159
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,830
implement the step routine is
to call the getNextValues,

1160
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:14,690
that is particular to the
subclass of interest.

1161
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,390
So for example, the
getNextValues for a turnstile,

1162
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:22,710
might be different from the
getNextValues for a planner or

1163
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:23,960
a for a mapper.

1164
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:33,970
Then we will subclass state
machine according to the kind

1165
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:35,590
of state machine we're making.

1166
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:40,380
A planner, a mapper, a
mover, a turnstile.

1167
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:43,790
So a turnstile will be a class,
which is a subclass of

1168
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:47,170
state machine, and that's where
we'll define how do you

1169
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,470
do getNextValues.

1170
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:52,870
If you're a turnstile, here's
the way you ought to do

1171
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:55,330
getNextValues.

1172
01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:57,990
When I call getNextValues, I'll
tell you your current

1173
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:01,600
state and the current input, and
from those two you ought

1174
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:07,070
to be able to figure out the
next state and the output.

1175
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:15,610
So the getNextValues method for
the turnstile class ought

1176
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,170
to take state and input--

1177
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:22,070
the input, and the current
state, and it generates a

1178
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:29,480
tuple, which is the new
state and the output.

1179
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,470
And this is the rule by
which it happens.

1180
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:37,420
All turnstiles also have
the same start state.

1181
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,260
So if you look back again at
state machine, state machine

1182
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,470
created the instance
variable, state, by

1183
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,900
looking at start's state.

1184
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,260
All turnstiles have the
same start state,

1185
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,930
they all start locked.

1186
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:58,280
And then finally, the way we'll
use this, is we will

1187
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,540
instantiate a turnstile, we
will make an instance of

1188
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:06,690
turnstile, put it into TS,
turnstile, so this could be

1189
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:09,900
Central Square 16,
for example.

1190
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,870
And then that instance, we'll
be able to do things like

1191
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,970
start, step, and transduce.

1192
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:22,189
So if I transduced this the
input, none, coin, none, turn,

1193
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:25,500
turn, coin, coin, on a
particular turnstile, I'll

1194
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,930
generate some sequence
of outputs like so.

1195
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,250
So that's a complicated example
using turnstiles.

1196
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,660
Let me do something simpler
just to make

1197
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,279
sure you get the idea.

1198
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,300
Let's think about a simpler
class, a subclass of state

1199
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,120
machines, a subclass
called accumulator.

1200
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,939
That subclass always has a start
state of 0, and has a

1201
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:54,790
getNextValues that returns the
same value for the next state

1202
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,040
and for the output.

1203
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,569
It always adds the current
state to the input--

1204
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,029
hence the name accumulator.

1205
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:07,160
It accumulates the input by
taking the current state,

1206
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,970
adding the currently input
to generate a new state--

1207
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,270
that's just like
a bank account.

1208
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:18,830
The bank account would
accumulate transactions.

1209
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:25,210
So if the input to the
accumulator is 7, then the

1210
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:29,410
state gets incremented by 7, and
the output is the value of

1211
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,330
the new state.

1212
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:33,210
So that's what this says, the
starting state is always 0,

1213
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,910
the getNextValues always returns
for this new state--

1214
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:40,670
state plus input, and for the
current output, the same thing

1215
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:43,399
as the current state.

1216
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,649
Everybody's clear?

1217
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,160
So the question is, what would
happen if I did this sequence

1218
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,689
of operations?

1219
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,410
Let's say that I have the state
machine class, I have

1220
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,220
the accumulator subclass.

1221
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:03,500
I make an instance A, I do some
stuff to A, I make an

1222
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,960
instance B. I do some stuff
to B, I do some stuff to

1223
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,820
A, and I type this.

1224
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,070
What gets printed?

1225
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,140
Take 30 seconds, talk to your
neighbor, figure out

1226
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:13,760
what the answer is.

1227
01:10:13,760 --> 01:12:58,030
[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION]

1228
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:59,280
PROFESSOR: OK.

1229
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,620
What will get printed by
the print statement?

1230
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,690
Answer (1), (2), (3),
(4), or (5).

1231
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,752
Everybody raise your hand
with an answer.

1232
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:13,560
Excellent, excellent,
almost 100%.

1233
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,820
I don't think I see a
single wrong answer.

1234
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:20,413
So everybody seems
to be saying (2).

1235
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:23,490
(2), OK, so what's going on?

1236
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:26,860
So A is an accumulator, we
start it, we step it.

1237
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:29,740
B is an accumulator, we start
it, we step it, we step.

1238
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:33,790
So what is going to be A,
how did you get five?

1239
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:36,460
Well, A started at 0 that's
what the start

1240
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:39,950
method does, right?

1241
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:42,750
Stepping it stepped it to 7.

1242
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:46,730
B made a new one, we can ignore
that because it's a

1243
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:48,690
separate instance.

1244
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:53,600
The idea is that the state is
associated with the instance.

1245
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,250
So when we perturb the state of
B by doing B.step, we are

1246
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,420
touching the state of A--

1247
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,290
because they're instance
variables.

1248
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,050
So that means when we
decrement it, we're

1249
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,810
decrementing the 7 to get 5.

1250
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:09,720
OK, seems reasonable.

1251
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,970
So the answer is either
(1), or (2), or none.

1252
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,510
Why is it the same (21, 21) (21,
21), when we called the

1253
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:26,470
A.getNextValues, and here we're
calling the B. Why are

1254
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,720
they the same?

1255
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:32,910
AUDIENCE: Because it sets
the state [INAUDIBLE].

1256
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:38,540
PROFESSOR: So getNextValues
is a pure function.

1257
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:43,900
So it gets passed in the state,
the first number is the

1258
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,400
state, the second number
is the input.

1259
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,780
So it doesn't pay any attention
to the instance

1260
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:55,870
variable state, it uses the
thing they got passed in.

1261
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,400
Furthermore, the getNextValues
associated with A, is

1262
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,430
precisely the same as the
getNextValues associated with

1263
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:08,240
B, because getNextValues is
something that's in the

1264
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,140
accumulator subclass.

1265
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,980
So they're exactly the same
because it's the same method.

1266
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,730
So what should be in your
head, is a picture

1267
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:19,160
that looks like this.

1268
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:22,880
When we said create a state
machine, that was something we

1269
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:28,190
put in our library, and that
makes this environment.

1270
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:34,300
When we said subclass of state
machine to make accumulator,

1271
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:39,020
that made a new class,
a new environment.

1272
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:42,890
And then when we made A and
B by saying that A equals

1273
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:43,880
accumulator, and B equals

1274
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,900
accumulator, that made instances.

1275
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:50,910
The instances were initially
empty, but when I say A.start,

1276
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:54,850
that created the state variable
in the A instance,

1277
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,630
and in the B instance, and
associated values with them.

1278
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:00,220
So with the picture that you're
supposed to have in

1279
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,010
mind, is that there's an
environment associated with

1280
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:05,580
state machine.

1281
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:10,150
There's a separate environment
associated with accumulator,

1282
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,730
but just one of those.

1283
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,250
But there's two instances.

1284
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,190
So there's two sets of instance
variables, one

1285
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:22,420
associated with A and B. So
the answer was number (2).

1286
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:26,090
Now the robot example was
supposed to motivate this idea

1287
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:28,690
that what we're going to do
with state machines is put

1288
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,440
them together modularly.

1289
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,140
So what we're going to do-- and
you start to do that this

1290
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,820
week, and also continuing into
next week, we'll figure out

1291
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:42,350
how to compose state machine
M1 and M2 in a cascade.

1292
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:45,670
That means the output of the
first one becomes the input to

1293
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,740
the second one.

1294
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,110
We'll put things together in
parallel, we'll put things

1295
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,450
together with feedback.

1296
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:55,140
So what we'll do, is we'll
figure out operators.

1297
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,720
PCAP--

1298
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,950
primitives, means
of combination,

1299
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,280
abstraction, patterns.

1300
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,720
The primitives are going to be
the state machines, the ways

1301
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:06,000
we combine them are going to be
these kinds of structures.

1302
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,140
Cascade them, put them in
parallel, that kind of stuff.

1303
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:13,840
And that's going to allow us to
make complicated brains out

1304
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,400
of simple ones.

1305
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,550
Here's a very simple example,
what if I had a state machine

1306
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,710
A, which is an accumulator,
so A is an instance of

1307
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:22,960
accumulator.

1308
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,410
B is an instance of accumulator,
there's two

1309
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:26,880
separate instances.

1310
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:36,100
And C is a new state composed
by cascading A and B. What

1311
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,565
would happen if I typed out
C.transduce so ([7, 3, 4])?

1312
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,280
What's the answer to C.transduce
([7,3,4])?

1313
01:17:48,280 --> 01:18:42,470
[AUDIENCE DISCUSSION]

1314
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:46,150
PROFESSOR: So what happens
when I transduce C?

1315
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:52,280
Well C is a composition of A
and B. In particular, it's

1316
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,860
this composition.

1317
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:58,980
C is just the cascade of A into
B. What that means is

1318
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,620
that if I put some sequence of
inputs into the first machine,

1319
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:06,340
and if I put some sequence of
the inputs into C, it's the

1320
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,950
same as putting it into A.

1321
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:14,440
The output of the composite
machine is the output of B.

1322
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,590
And the input to B is the same
as the output of A. So the

1323
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:22,040
([7,3,4]) goes through A, which
is an accumulator, and

1324
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,510
comes out [7, 10, 14].

1325
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,820
It accumulates, that's
what accumulators do.

1326
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,560
That clear?

1327
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,340
Then [7, 10, 14]

1328
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,175
goes into B and comes
out [7, 17, 31].

1329
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,170
So C, which is the cascade of
two accumulators, ends up

1330
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:44,310
transforming [7, 3, 4]

1331
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,560
into [7, 17, 31].

1332
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:53,370
So that's the idea for how
we're going to compose

1333
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:57,590
complicated behaviors out of
simple ones, and that's what

1334
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:59,240
the assignment is
for this week.
