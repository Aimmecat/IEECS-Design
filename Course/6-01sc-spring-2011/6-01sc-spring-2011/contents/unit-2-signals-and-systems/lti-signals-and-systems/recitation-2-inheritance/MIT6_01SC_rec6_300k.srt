00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,420

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,240
PROFESSOR: Hi.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,420
Today I'd like to talk about
signals and systems again.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,960
At this point, you're probably
familiar with the motivation

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,410
for why we're talking about
discrete linear time and

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,330
variant systems, and also with
a few of the representations

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,800
that we're going to end up
using in this course.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,190
But you're still not sure what
it is that we're trying to

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,770
accomplish.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,260
Or where's the part where we
get to predict the future

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,110
based on the fact that
we are capable of

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,990
manipulating these systems?

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,940
Well, we actually have
to be capable of

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,940
manipulating these systems.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,020
And at this point, we can
describe this system as we see

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,025
it, but we can't also manipulate
its representation

17
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,380
in ways that make sense to us.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,420
So the thing that I'm going
to do today is talk about

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,650
different system equivalences
and how to take a system and

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,680
solve for an expression that
represents a complex system

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,200
and also how if you know that
some things in your system are

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,340
equivalent, how you can
convert between them.

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,560
At that point, we should be
able to talk about poles,

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,890
which is how we're going to
actually predict the future.

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,950
So different equivalences that
I'd like to talk about.

26
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,750
I'm first going to briefly
review the facts that last

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,190
time we discovered the notion
of system function, right?

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,090
We can take a representation
of a system and abstract it

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,750
away into some sort of function,
where we take the

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,410
input as it's given to us and
then multiply it by this

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,510
function and then get
the output that

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,110
we're interested in.

33
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,470
How do we deal with something
more complex?

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,120

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,990
I mean, y is all the
way over here.

36
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,680
And we've got multiple
system functions.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,960
And I don't even know what
happens here, but it doesn't

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,090
have to be that scary.

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,340
Let's break it down.

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,280

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,630
One of the easiest ways to
approach something like this

42
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,230
is to identify each position
where you have a new signal,

43
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,530
or if you were to sample here,
you would have a new signal,

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,980
and label those values
appropriately.

45
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:09,009

46
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,210
You can then start with your
final output and then back

47
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,670
solve for the values that you're
interested in as a

48
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,090
consequence of that
final output.

49
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,606
In this particular example, y
is going to be y2 plus y3.

50
00:02:23,606 --> 00:02:28,100

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:40,820
y2 is going to be y1
times H2, where H2

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,980
is some system function.

53
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,520
And it probably is abstracting
away some combination of

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,320
gains, delays, and adders
like this one here.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,460

56
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:01,944
y1 is going to be x times H1.

57
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:05,402

58
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:09,120
And Y3 is going to
be x times H3.

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:20,160

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,200
Now I've got all my expressions
in terms of either

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,310
y or something for which
I have an equivalent

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,930
expression for x.

63
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,240
So I can do my substitutions,
come up for an expression for

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,270
y over x, in terms of
H1, H2, and H3.

65
00:03:38,270 --> 00:04:18,620

66
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,480
Here I've just made the
substitutions of the equations

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:48,760
above and factored out the x.

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,820
If I wanted the system function,
I would then just

69
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,620
divide by x.

70
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,720
And then I would have y over x
is equal to this expression.

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,850
The thing I wanted to indicate
is that if I wanted to

72
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:05,320
abstract this away into its own
box-- maybe I wanted like

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,840
a big H or an H0 or something
like that--

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,570
and it represented what was
happening in this top line,

75
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,170
cascading two system functions
is the functional equivalent

76
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,600
of multiplying them together.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,420
So if I have an expression for
H1 and I have an expression

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,590
for H2, and I want the
expression that is equal to

79
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,430
cascading H1 and H2, I just
multiply them together.

80
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,280

81
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,200
Likewise, if I want an
expression for the linear

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,080
combination of two system
functions applied to an input

83
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:46,580
individually, like the
combination H1 and H2, and H3,

84
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,990
it's a summation of those
two values which

85
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,670
is expressed here.

86
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,670
This is the same as the
relationship that we reviewed

87
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,080
in a very basic sense when we
were originally doing the

88
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,910
accumulator.

89
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,817
The only thing I'm attempting
to indicate is that, that

90
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:06,450
relationship scales to an
arbitrary level of complexity.

91
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,670
So if you need to, you could
shift around these values, if

92
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,960
you can find some sort
of equivalence.

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,300
Let's see what happens when
H2 is equal to H3.

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,690

95
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,940
I'm going to take my
operator equation.

96
00:06:23,940 --> 00:07:03,980

97
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,110
What this means is that if I
wanted to rewrite this block

98
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:14,450
diagram, I could do
so by doing--

99
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:41,980

100
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,760
This is really similar
to bubble pushing.

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,300
If you've done 6.004 or 6.002
and have experience with logic

102
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,990
gates, I just wanted to indicate
that it's also a

103
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,220
thing that you can do for block

104
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,470
diagrams and system functions.

105
00:07:52,470 --> 00:08:00,940

106
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,450
There's one more type of
equivalence that I want to

107
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,850
talk about.

108
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,155
I call it feedback
equivalence.

109
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:09,300

110
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,820
Here's our normal accumulator
rate.

111
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:20,700

112
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,190
If I wanted to represent this
feedback system as a feed

113
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,440
forward system, what
would I have to do?

114
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,310

115
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,080
Well, the first time that
I sampled from x, it

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,390
would just be y.

117
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,620
So right now this diagram
matches for

118
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,919
the first time step.

119
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,230
On the second time step, if I
had an input from x from the

120
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:50,060
previous time step, I would also
want to account for it by

121
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,800
putting in a delay and then
summing it with the current

122
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,110
value of x in order to get y.

123
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:08,660
At the second time step, I
would want access to the

124
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:18,660
starting value, the value from
the previous time step, and

125
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,150
the value from the current
time step.

126
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,260
And one more time, to exhaust
the example, at the third time

127
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:45,680
step, my output would be a
linear combination of the

128
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,520
starting value, the value from
the first time step, the value

129
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,950
from the second time step, and
the value from the current

130
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,200
third time step.

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:05,750

132
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,030
We'd end up doing this
ad nauseum to model

133
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,930
our feedback system.

134
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,230
So it's difficult to do on
paper, but it turns out

135
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,190
there's a great relationship
between these two equivalences

136
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,605
and things that we already
know from--

137
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:25,400

138
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,690
I want to say high school
calculus or

139
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,370
possibly 18.01, 18.02.

140
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,620
Geometric sequences.

141
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,500

142
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,210
When we solved for the system
function, we found an

143
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:44,120
expression for our
feedback system.

144
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:52,570

145
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,960
If I wanted to find an
equivalent expression using

146
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,400
this feed forward system, I
would look at this infinite

147
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,130
summation of x terms.

148
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:18,170

149
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,290
So if I wanted to know something
about the long-term

150
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,710
behavior of the system, in terms
of this system function,

151
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,810
I would solve for this
expression and then using my

152
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:39,475
knowledge of geometric
sequences, in order to express

153
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,790
the long-term behavior.

154
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,690
In the general sense, in this
course, we're going to be

155
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,450
looking at the unit sample
response of a system.

156
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,360

157
00:11:50,360 --> 00:12:11,710
What that means is, if the only
thing I ever do for input

158
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:22,930
is a single value of 1 at
time 0, then what does

159
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,650
my output look like?

160
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,510
The reason we're looking at the
unit sample response is

161
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,540
because it's (a) the simplest
way to look at the long-term

162
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,990
behavior of a discrete linear
time invariant system.

163
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,220
But the other reason (b) is --
once we have this, we can also

164
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,970
use it to do things like to
make predictions about the

165
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,300
long-term step response
and other more

166
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,710
complicated input signals.

167
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,650

168
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,280
In the case of the accumulator,
if I input 1 at

169
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:08,140
time 0, my output is going
to be 1 forever more.

170
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:18,130

171
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:28,050
That's reflected in
the coefficient of

172
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,300
my geometric sequence.

173
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,800

174
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,940
If I want to know what my
long-term response is going to

175
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,690
look like, I can look at the
coefficient of R and make a

176
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,630
decision about whether or not
I'm going to diverge or

177
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,970
converge or do neither.

178
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,070

179
00:13:50,070 --> 00:14:47,460
So if I put a coefficient on R,
whatever p0 converges to is

180
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,510
what my system is going
to converge to.

181
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,510
So using my knowledge of p0, I
can make long-term predictions

182
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:58,920
about the behavior
of the system.

183
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,440
Next time I'm going to go over
some general classifications

184
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,180
of those behaviors for the
system and how to more

185
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,040
effectively use our knowledge
of p0 and how to deal with

186
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,290
things like second
order systems.

187
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,717
