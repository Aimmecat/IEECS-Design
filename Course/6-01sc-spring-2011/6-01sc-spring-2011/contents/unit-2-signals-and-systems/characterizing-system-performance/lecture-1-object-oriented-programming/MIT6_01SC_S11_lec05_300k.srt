10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,520
PROFESSOR: Last time, which is
now two weeks ago, we started

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,050
the talk about the signals and
systems approach, by which I

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,890
mean, think about a system by
the way it transforms its

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,090
input signal into an
output signal.

14
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,520
That's kind of a bizarre way
of thinking about systems.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,690
I demonstrated that last time by
thinking about a mass and a

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,760
spring, something you have a
lot of experience with, but

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,680
you probably didn't use this
kind of approach for

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,060
thinking about it.

19
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,020
Over this lecture and over the
next lecture, what I'd like to

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,455
do is show you the advantages
of this kind of approach.

21
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:04,920
And so for today, what I'd like
to do is talk about how

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,900
to think about feedback within
this structure, and I'd like

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,260
to also think about how you
can use this structure to

24
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,760
characterize the performance
of a system in a

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,900
quantitative fashion.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,400
So first off, I want to just
think about feedback.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,370
Feedback is so pervasive
that you don't notice

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,470
it most of the time.

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,110
You use feedback in virtually
everything that you do.

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,680
Here is a very simple example
of driving a car.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,050
If you want to keep the car in
the center of your lane,

32
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,630
something that many people
outside of Boston, at least,

33
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,880
think is a good idea, then you
are mentally doing feedback.

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,370
You're constantly comparing
where you are to where you'd

35
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,950
like to be and making small
adjustments to the system

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,760
based on that.

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,900
When you think of even the most
simple of systems, like

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,920
the thermostat in a house--

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,110
I'm not talking about
a cheap motel.

40
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,550
The cheap motels
don't do this.

41
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,540
But in a real house, there's a
thermostat, which regulates

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,060
the temperature.

43
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,160
That's important, because if
the temperature suddenly

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,550
drops, it would never do that
of course, but if the

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,790
temperature ever dropped, it
could compensate for it.

46
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,070
Here's one of my favorite
examples.

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,280
Feedback is enormously
pervasive in biology.

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,770
There's no general rules in
biology, but to a first cut,

49
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,250
everything is regulated.

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,550
And in many cases, the
regulation is amazing.

51
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,930
Here's an example from 6.021,
where it's illustrating the

52
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,540
system that your body uses to
regulate glucose delivery from

53
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,330
food sources to every cell in
your body, which is crucial to

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,950
your being cognizant
and mobile.

55
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,600

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,580
And the idea is that it does
that with amazing precision

57
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,690
despite the fact that
eating and exercise

58
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,880
are enormously episodic.

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,970
In order for you to remain
healthy and functional, you

60
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,220
need to have something between
approximately two and ten

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,510
millimoles per liter
of glucose in your

62
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,260
blood at all times.

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,380
Were it to go higher than that,
systematically, you

64
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,050
would develop cardiac problems
and could lead to even

65
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,170
congestive heart failure.

66
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,310
If you were to have lower than
two millimoles per liter, you

67
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,420
would go comatose.

68
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,470
That's a very narrow range,
two to five, especially

69
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,260
because what we eat is so
episodic, when we exercise is

70
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,430
so episodic.

71
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,440
It's amazing, and just to
dramatize how amazing it is,

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,140
how much sugar do you
think circulates in

73
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,390
your blood right now?

74
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,970

75
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,430
Well, if you convert five
millimoles per liter, and if

76
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,540
you assume the average person
has about three liters of

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,290
blood, which is true, and if you
calculate it, that comes

78
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,920
out to 2.7 grams.

79
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,150
That's this much.

80
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,690
This is 2.7 grams
of table sugar.

81
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,800

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,740
So this is how much sugar
is in your blood, now.

83
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,800
This is what's keeping
you healthy.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,730
This is what's keeping you
from becoming comatose.

85
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,980
Or not.

86
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,310

87
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,288
How much sugar do you
think is in this?

88
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,650
AUDIENCE: The amount
in that other cup.

89
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,110
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

90
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,690
We call that the Theory
of Lectures.

91
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't want to look like
an idiot, so my

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,220
problems make sense.

93
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,550
This is the amount of sugar
in a can of soda.

94
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,160

95
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,970
Numerically, this is 39 grams.

96
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,140

97
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,350
That's more than 13
times this much.

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,080
So when you down one of these,
it's very important that the

99
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,400
sugar gets taken out of the
blood quickly, and it does.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,710
And that happens by way of a
feedback system, and the

101
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,850
feedback system is
illustrated here.

102
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,510
Basically, the feedback involves
the hormone insulin,

103
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,370
and that's why insulin
deficiency is such a

104
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,620
devastating disease.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,890

106
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,690
Finally, everything we do
has feedback in it.

107
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,400
Think about how your
life would be

108
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,520
different if it didn't.

109
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,150
Even a simple task, like
removing a light bulb, would

110
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,300
be virtually impossible except
for the fact that you get

111
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,610
feedback from everything.

112
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,170
Your hand's amazing.

113
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,240
You have touch sensors, you have
proprioceptive sensors,

114
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,160
you have stress sensors on the
muscles and ligaments, and

115
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,520
they all coordinate to tell you
when to stop squeezing on

116
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,310
the light bulb so you
don't break it.

117
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,800
That's all completely amazing,
and what we'd like to do,

118
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,070
then, is think about that kind
of a system, a feedback

119
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,450
system, within the signals
and systems construct.

120
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,330
As an example, I want to think
through the WallFinder problem

121
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,820
that you did last week
in Design Lab.

122
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,670
I'm sure you all remember that,
in that problem, we were

123
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,300
trying to move the robot to a
fixed distance away from the

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,220
wall, and we thought about
that as a feedback system

125
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,820
comprised of three parts,
a controller, a

126
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,180
plant, and a sensor.

127
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,800
We wrote difference equations to
characterize each of those

128
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,130
parts, and then we figured out
how to solve those difference

129
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,100
equations to make some
meaningful prediction about

130
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,350
how the robot would work.

131
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,690

132
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,905
So just to make sure you're
all on board with me, now,

133
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,210
here's a question for you.

134
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,990
These are the equations
that describe

135
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,760
the WallFinder problem.

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,560
How many equations and how
many unknowns are there?

137
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,860

138
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,870
Take 20 seconds, talk to your
neighbor, figure out an answer

139
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,120
between (1) and (5).

140
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:09,920

141
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,490
Unlike during the exam next
week, you are allowed to talk.

142
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:19,915

143
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:39,220
[CLASSROOM SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

[CLASSROOM SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

146
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,614
PROFESSOR: OK, so what's the
answer, number (1), (2), (3),

147
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:12,060
(4), or (5)?

148
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,160
Everybody raise your hands.

149
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,010
Let me see if I got the answer.

150
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,920
OK.

151
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,890
Come on, raise your hands.

152
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,050
Come on, everybody vote.

153
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,010
If you're wrong, just blame
it on your neighbor.

154
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,240
You had a poor partner.

155
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,020
That's the idea.

156
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,730
Right?

157
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,530
So you can all vote, and you
don't need to worry about

158
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,540
being wrong.

159
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,520
And you're all wrong, so
that worked out well.

160
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,960
OK, so I don't like the-- so
the predominant answer is

161
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,190
number (2).

162
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,200
I don't like number (2).

163
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,740
Can somebody think of a reason,
now that you know the

164
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,909
answer by the Theory
of Lectures, the

165
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,159
answer is not (2)?

166
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,060

167
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,170
Why isn't the answer (2)?

168
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah?

169
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,110

saying (5).

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,590
PROFESSOR: You were
saying (5).

171
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,682
Why did you say (5)?

172
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:59,852
AUDIENCE: I don't remember for
sure, but can you substitute n

173
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:01,092
for different things?

174
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:05,804
Like Df of n, you could
substitute n for, and if you

175
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:07,788
did that you would have two
equations, which is

kind of thing, you count

178
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,502
before or after doing
substitution and

179
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,240
simplification.

180
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,940
And I mean to count before
you do simplification.

181
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,065
Any other issues?

182
00:09:22,065 --> 00:09:22,540
Yeah?

183
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,865
AUDIENCE: Is D0 [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

184
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,730

185
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,422
PROFESSOR: Say again?

186
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:32,185
AUDIENCE: D0 [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

187
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:36,000
PROFESSOR: Is D0_n different
or the same from D0_n-1?

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,310
That's the key question.

189
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,330
So I want to think about this
as a system of algebraic

190
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,615
equations, and if I do that,
then there's a lot of them.

191
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:50,545

192
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,790
So it looks like there's
three equations.

193
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,620
The problem with that approach
is that there's actually three

194
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,670
equations for every
value of n.

195
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,000
If you think about a system of
equations that you could solve

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,940
with an algebra solver, you
would have to treat all the

197
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,050
n's separately.

198
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,600
That's what we call the
samples approach.

199
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,660
So here's a way you
could solve them.

200
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,660
You could think about what if
k and t are parameters, so

201
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,730
they're known, they're given?

202
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,500
What if my input signal is
known, say it's a unit sample

203
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,220
signal, for example?

204
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,650
What would I need to
solve this system?

205
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,400
Well, I'd need to tell you
the initial conditions.

206
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,810
So in some sense, I want to
consider those to be known.

207
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:46,290
So my knowns kind of comprise
t and k, the initial

208
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:52,680
conditions for the output of the
robot, and the sensor, all

209
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,650
of the input signals because I'm
telling you the input and

210
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,230
asking you to calculate
the output.

211
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,700
My unknowns are all of the
different velocities for all

212
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,260
values of n bigger than or equal
to 0 because I didn't

213
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,360
tell you those.

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,990
All of the values of robot's
output at samples

215
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,100
n bigger than 0.

216
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,510
All the values of the sensor
output for values

217
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,750
n bigger than 0.

218
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,030
So I get a lot of unknowns,
infinitely many, and I get a

219
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,380
lot of equations, also
infinitely many.

220
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,670
So the thing I want you think
about is, if you're thinking

221
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,050
about solving difference
equations using algebra,

222
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,565
that's a big system
of equations.

223
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,320

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,320
By contrast, what if you were
to try to solve the system

225
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,570
using operators?

226
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,990

227
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,470
Now, how many equations and
unknowns do you see?

228
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,990

229
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,515
By the Theory of Lectures.

230
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:56,610

231
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,430
OK, raise your hand.

232
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,736
Or talk to your neighbor so you
can blame your neighbor.

233
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:05,196
Talk to your neighbor.

234
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,180
Get a good alibi.

235
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:25,880
[CLASSROOM SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

236
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,830
PROFESSOR: So the idea here
is that if you think about

237
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,030
operators instead, so that you
look at a whole signal at a

238
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:38,620
time, then each equation only
specifies one relationship

239
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,070
among signals, and there's a
small number of signals.

240
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,970
So if I think about the knowns
being k, t the parameters and

241
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,040
the signal d(i), and if I think
about the unknowns being

242
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,520
the velocity, the output, and
the sensor signal, then I get

243
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,160
three equations and
three unknowns.

244
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,190
So one of the values of thinking
about the operator

245
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,480
approach is that it just simply
reduces the amount of

246
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,530
things you need to
think about.

247
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,020
It reduces complexity.

248
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,030
That's what we're trying
to do in this course.

249
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,460
We're trying to think of methods
that allow you to

250
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,180
solve problems by reducing
complexity.

251
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,470
We would like, ultimately,
to solve very complicated

252
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,740
problems, and this operator
approach is an approach that

253
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,380
lets you do that.

254
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,360
It does a lot more
than that, too.

255
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,900
It also generates new
kinds of insights.

256
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,840
So it lets you focus on the
relations, but the relation is

257
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,800
now not quite the same
as we would have

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,140
expected from algebra.

259
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,290
Now, the relation between the
input signal and the output

260
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,390
signal is an operator.

261
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,580
We're going to represent the
operation that transforms the

262
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,080
input to the output
by this symbol, h.

263
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,300
We'll call that the
system functional.

264
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,690
It's an operator.

265
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,255
It's a thing that, when operated
on x, gives you y.

266
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:06,160

267
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,890
And this is one of the main
purposes of today's lecture,

268
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,860
it's also convenient to think
about h as a ratio.

269
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,250
We like to think of it that
way because, as we'll see,

270
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,310
there's a way of thinking
about h as a ratio of

271
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,790
polynomials in R. So two ways
of thinking about it.

272
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,190
We're trying to develop a
signals and systems approach

273
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,900
for thinking about feedback.

274
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,530
We want to think about the
input goes into a box.

275
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,210
The box represents
an operation.

276
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,950
We will characterize that
by a functional.

277
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,610
We'll call the functional h.

278
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,890
The functional, when applied
to the input, produces the

279
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,660
output, and what we'd like to do
is infer what is the nature

280
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,400
of that functional, and what
are the properties of the

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,920
system that functional
represents.

282
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,970

283
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,450
OK, so I see that you're
all with me.

284
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,530
Think about the WallFinder
system.

285
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,790
Think about the equations for
the various components of that

286
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,000
system when expressed
an operator form.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,930
And figure out the system
functional for that system.

288
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,280
figure out the ratio of
polynomials that can be in r

289
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,420
that is represented by h.

290
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,500
Take 30 seconds, talk to your
neighbor, figure out whether

291
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,750
the answer is (1), (2),
(3), (4), or (5).

292
00:15:20,750 --> 00:17:45,980

293
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,230
So what's the answer -- (1),
(2), (3), (4), or (5)?

294
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,670

295
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,910
Come on, more voter
participation.

296
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,600
All right?

297
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,850
Blame it on your partner.

298
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,630

299
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,990
OK, virtually 100% correct.

300
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,690
So the idea is algebra.

301
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,180
You solve the operator equations
exactly as though

302
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,670
they were algebraic.

303
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,640
Here, I've started with the
second equation and just done

304
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,970
substitutions until I got
rid of everything other

305
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,220
than d(0) and d(i).

306
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,280

307
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,730
So I express v in terms of ke,
then I express e in terms of

308
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,640
d(i) minus rd(0).

309
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,110
Then I'm left with one equation
that relates d(0) and

310
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,140
d(i), which I can solve
for the ratio.

311
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,830

312
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:41,830
And the answer comes out there,
which was number (3).

313
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,240
Point is that you can treat the
operator just as though it

314
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,103
were algebra, so that results
in enormous implications.

315
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,760

316
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,660
But what we want to understand
is what's the relationship

317
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,230
between that functional, that
thing that we just calculated,

318
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,040
and the behaviors.

319
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,710
These are the kinds of behaviors
that you observed

320
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,850
with the WallFinder system.

321
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,328
When you built the WallFinder
system, depending on what you

322
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:13,280
made k, you could get behaviors
that were monotonic

323
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,360
and slow, faster and
oscillatory, or even faster

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,250
and even more oscillatory.

325
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,120
And what we'd like to know is,
before we build it, how should

326
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,640
we have constructed the
system so that it

327
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,770
has a desirable behavior?

328
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,010
And, incidentally, are these
the best you can do?

329
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,790
Or is there some other set of
parameters that's lurking

330
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,700
behind some door that we just
don't know about, and if we

331
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,150
could discover it, it would
work a lot better?

332
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,300
So the question is, given the
structure of our problem,

333
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,860
what's the most general kind of
answer that we can expect?

334
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,670
And how do we choose the best
behavior out of that set of

335
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,280
possible behaviors?

336
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,596
So that's what I want to think
about for the rest of the hour

337
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:05,020
and a half, and I want to
begin by taking a step

338
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,180
backwards and look at
something simpler.

339
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,440
The idea's going to be the same
as the idea that we used

340
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
when we studied Python.

341
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,760
I want to find simple behaviors,
think about that as

342
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,070
a primitive, and combine
primitives to get a more

343
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,710
complicated behavior, so I want
to use an approach that's

344
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,240
very much PCAP.

345
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,770
Find the most simple behavior,
and then see if I can leverage

346
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,310
that simple behavior to somehow
understand more

347
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,270
complicated things.

348
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,940
So let's think about this very
simple system that has a

349
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,170
feedback loop that has a delay
in it and a gain of P0.

350
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,250
What I want to do is think
about what would be the

351
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,130
response of that very simple
system if the input were a

352
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,550
unit sample.

353
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,355
So find y, given that the
input x is delta.

354
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,060

355
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,630
In order to do that, I have to
start the system somehow.

356
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,160
I will start it at rest.

357
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,890
You've all seen already, I'm
sure, that rest is the

358
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,340
simplest assumption
I can make.

359
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,520
I'll say something at the end of
the hour about how you deal

360
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,950
with things that are
not at rest.

361
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,140
For the time being, we'll
just assume rest

362
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,600
because that's simple.

363
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,950
Assume that the system is at
rest, that means that the

364
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,280
output of every delay
box is 0.

365
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,360
That's what rest means.

366
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,820
If the output of this starts at
0, then the output of the

367
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,970
scale by P0 is also 0.

368
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,530
And if that's 0, and if the
input is at 0 because I'm at

369
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:40,070
time before 0, then the output
is 0, indicated here.

370
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:47,320
So now if I step, then the
input becomes 1 because

371
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,920
delta of 0 is 1.

372
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,390
The output of the delay box is
still 0, so the first answer

373
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,010
is 1, the 1 just propagates
straight through

374
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,260
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] box.

375
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,490

376
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,990
Then I step, and the 1 that was
here goes through the r

377
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:12,150
and becomes 1, the 1 goes
through P0 and becomes P0, but

378
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,210
at the same time, the 1 that
was at the input goes to 0

379
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,870
because the input is 1 only
at time equals 0.

380
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,030
So the result, then, is that
after one step, the

381
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,950
output has become P0.

382
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,180
This propagated to 1, that
became P0, add it to 0, and it

383
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,250
became P0, so now the answer,
which had been 1, is P0.

384
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,940

385
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,250
On the next step, a very
similar thing happens.

386
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,190
The P0 that was here becomes the
output of the delay, gets

387
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,370
multiplied by P0 to give you P0
squared, gets added to 0 to

388
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,140
give you P0 squared,
et cetera.

389
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,560

390
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,460
The thing that I want you to see
is that the output was in

391
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,710
some sense simple.

392
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,530

393
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,930
The value simply increased as
P0 to the n, geometrically.

394
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,370
There's another way we
can think about that.

395
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,510
I just did the sample by sample
approach, but the whole

396
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,270
theme of this part
of the course

397
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,810
is the signals approach.

398
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:21,630
If I think about the whole
signal in one fell swoop, then

399
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,570
I can develop an operator
expression to

400
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,400
characterize the system.

401
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,760
The operator expression says the
signal y is constructed by

402
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,090
adding the signal x to
the signal P0RY.

403
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,610

404
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,660
If I solve that for the ratio of
the output to input, I get

405
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,300
1 over (1 minus P0R).

406
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,702
Again, going back to the idea
that I started with, that

407
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:49,060
we're going to get ratios of
polynomials in R now the R is

408
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,390
in the bottom, and now I can
expand that just as though it

409
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,760
were an algebraic expression.

410
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,730
I can expand 1 over P0R in
a power series by using

411
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,630
synthetic division.

412
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,820
The result is very similar in
structure to the result we saw

413
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,230
in sample by sample.

414
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,410
It consists of an ascending
series in R, which means an

415
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,320
ascending number of delays.

416
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,300
Every time you increase the
number of delays by 1, you

417
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,770
also multiply the amplitude by
P0, so this is, in fact, the

418
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,320
same kind of result,
but viewed from a

419
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,490
signal point of view.

420
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,000
Finally, I want to think about
it in terms of block diagrams.

421
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,570
Same idea, I've got the same
feedback system, but now I

422
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,870
want to take advantage of this
ascending series expansion

423
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,870
that I did and think about
each of the terms in that

424
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,720
series as a signal flow path
through the feedback system.

425
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,970
So one, the first term in the
ascending series, represents

426
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,730
the path that goes directly from
the input to the output,

427
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,980
passing through no delays.

428
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,840

429
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,370
The second term in the series,
P0R, represents the path that

430
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,900
goes to the output, loops
around, comes back through the

431
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,890
adder, and then comes out.

432
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,490
In traversing that more
complicated path, you picked

433
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,120
up 1 delay and 1
multiply by P0.

434
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,990
Second term, two loops.

435
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,300
Third term, three loops.

436
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,560
Fourth term, four loops.

437
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,440
The idea is that the block
diagram gives us a way to

438
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,930
visualize how the answer
came about.

439
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:43,620
It came about by all the
possible paths that lead from

440
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,820
the input to the output.

441
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,660
Those possible paths all
differed by a delay, and

442
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,090
that's why the decomposition
was so simple, each path

443
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,610
corresponding to a different
number of

444
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,620
delays through the system.

445
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,660
That won't always be true from
more complicated systems, but

446
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,760
it is true for this one.

447
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,170
This flow diagram also lets
you see something that's

448
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,420
extremely interesting.

449
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,170

450
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,540
Cyclical flow paths, which are
characteristic of feedback--

451
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,780
feedback means the signal
comes back.

452
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:24,720
Cyclical flow paths require that
transient inputs generate

453
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,240
persistent outputs.

454
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,670
They generate persistent outputs
because the output at

455
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,450
time n is not triggered by
the input at time n.

456
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,830
It's triggered by the output
at time n minus 1.

457
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,880
It keeps going on itself.

458
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,550
That's fundamental
to feedback.

459
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,720
There's no way of getting
around that.

460
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,690
That's what feedback is.

461
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,150
And it also shows why you got
that funny oscillatory

462
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,000
behavior in WallFinder.

463
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,670
There wasn't any way
around that.

464
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,760
Feedback meant that you
were looping back.

465
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,790
That meant that there
was a cycle in

466
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,230
the signal flow paths.

467
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,060
That means that even transient
signals, signals that go away

468
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,650
very quickly like the
[INAUDIBLE] sample, generate

469
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,070
responses that go on forever.

470
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,540

471
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,680
So that's a fundamental way
of thinking about systems.

472
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,460
Systems are either feedforward
or feedback.

473
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,230
Feedforward means that
there are no cyclic

474
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,320
paths in the system.

475
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,830

476
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,390
No path in the system that take
you from the input to the

477
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,650
output has a cycle in it.

478
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,820
That's what acyclic means.

479
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,760
That's what feedforward means.

480
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,350
Acyclic, feedforward, those
all have responses to

481
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,880
transient inputs that
are transient.

482
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,600
That contrasts with
cyclic systems.

483
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,160
A cyclic system has feedback
and will have the property

484
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,590
that transient signals
can generate

485
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,200
outputs that go on forever.

486
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,830
OK, how many of these
systems are cyclic?

487
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,560
Easy questions.

488
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,815
15 seconds, talk to
your neighbor.

489
00:28:16,815 --> 00:29:46,420

490
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,080
OK, so what's the answer?

491
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,900
How many?

492
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,310
OK, virtually 100%.

493
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,720
Correct, the answer's (3).

494
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,610
I've illustrated the cycles in
red, so there's a cycle here,

495
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,730
there's two cycles in this one,
and there's a cycle here.

496
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,340
So the idea is that, when you
see a block diagram, one of

497
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,120
the first things you want to
characterize, because it's

498
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,790
such a big difference between
systems, is whether or not

499
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,580
there's a cycle in it.

500
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,710
If there's a cycle, then you
know there's feedback.

501
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,460
If there's feedback, then you
know you have the potential to

502
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,715
have a persistent response to
even a transient signal.

503
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:22,870

504
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,860
OK, so if you only have one
loop of the type that I

505
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,340
started with, where we had just
one loop with an R and a

506
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:36,680
P0, then the question is, as you
go around the loop, do the

507
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,750
samples get bigger,
or smaller, or do

508
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,570
they stay the same?

509
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,130
That's a fundamental
characterization of how the

510
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,030
simple feedback system works.

511
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,810
So here, if on every cycle the
amplitude of the signal

512
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,650
diminishes by multiplication by
half, that means that the

513
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,730
response ultimately decays.

514
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,370
Mathematically, it goes on
forever, just like I said

515
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:05,440
previously, but the amplitude is
decaying, so practically it

516
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,410
stops after a while.

517
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,090
It becomes small enough that
you lose track of it.

518
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,410
By contrast, if every time you
go around the loop, you pick

519
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:18,990
up amplitude, if the amplitude
here were multiplied by 1.2,

520
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,330
then it gets bigger.

521
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,900
So the idea, then, is that you
can characterize this kind of

522
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,490
a feedback by one number.

523
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,460
We call that number the pole.

524
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,350
Very mysterious word.

525
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,270
I won't go into the origins
of the word.

526
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,120
For our purposes, it just simply
means the base of the

527
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,270
geometric sequence that
characterizes the response of

528
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,440
a system to the unit
sample signal.

529
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,140
So here, I've showed an
illustration of what can

530
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,270
happen if p is 1/2, p is one,
p is 1.2, which you can see

531
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,485
decay, persistence,
divergence.

532
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,780

533
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,840
Can you characterize
this system by P0?

534
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,231
And if so, what is P0?

535
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:21,950

536
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,210
Yes?

537
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,317
No?

538
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:30,772
[CLASSROOM SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

539
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,008
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and virtually
everybody's

540
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:33,754
getting the right answer.

541
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:35,710
The right answer's (2).

542
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,960
So we like algebra.

543
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,170
We like negative numbers, so
we're allowed to think about

544
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,310
poles being negative.

545
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,000
In fact, by the end of the hour,
we'll even think about

546
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,820
poles having imaginary parts,
but for the time

547
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,440
being, this is fine.

548
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,400
If the pole were negative,
what that means is the

549
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,370
consecutive terms in the unit
sample response, the response

550
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,960
of the system to a unit sample
signal, the unit sample

551
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,800
response, the unit sample
response can

552
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,050
alternate in sine.

553
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,420

554
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,320
OK, so this then represents
all the possible behaviors

555
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,000
that you could get from
a feedback system

556
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,020
with a single pole.

557
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,360
If a feedback system has
a single pole, the only

558
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,110
behaviors that you can
get are represented

559
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,480
by these three cartoons.

560
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,310

561
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,895
So here, this z-axis contains
all possible values of P0.

562
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:44,540
If P0 is bigger than 1, then
the magnitude diverges, and

563
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,010
the signal grows
monotonically.

564
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:53,340
If the pole is between 0 and
1, the response is also

565
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:00,870
monotonic, but now it
converges towards 0.

566
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,350
If you flip the sign, the
relations are still the same,

567
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,360
except that you now get
sign alternation.

568
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,159
So if the P0 is between 0 and
minus 1, which is here, the

569
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,989
output still converges because
the magnitude of the pole is

570
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,429
less than 1.

571
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,659
But now the sign flips.

572
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:28,139
And if the pole is below minus
1, then you get alternation,

573
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,460
but you also get divergence.

574
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,710
The important thing is we
started with a simple system,

575
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,699
and we ended up with an
absolutely complete

576
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,610
characterization of it.

577
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,090
This is everything
that can happen.

578
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:41,860
That's a powerful statement.

579
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,050
When I can analyze a system,
even if it's simple, and find

580
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,974
all the possible behaviors,
I have something.

581
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:50,360

582
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,820
If you have a simple system with
a single pole, this is

583
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,460
all that can happen.

584
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,350
There might be offsets.

585
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,770
There might be delays.

586
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,810
The signal may not start until
the fifth sample, but the

587
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,660
persistent signal will either
grow without bounds, the k to

588
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,250
0, or do one of those two
with alternating sign.

589
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,970
That's the only things that can
happen, which of course,

590
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,130
begs the question, well, what
if the system's more

591
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,640
complicated.

592
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,730
OK, so here's a more
complicated system.

593
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,260
This system cannot be
represented by just one pole.

594
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,280
In fact, the system's
complicated enough you should

595
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,400
think through how you
would solve it.

596
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,570
You should all be very
comfortable with

597
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,590
this sort of thing.

598
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:47,210
So if you were to think about
what if I had a system like

599
00:35:47,210 --> 00:36:02,670
so, and I want it to
be 1.6 minus 0.63.

600
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:09,080
What would be the output signal
at time 2 if the input

601
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,830
were a unit sample signal?

602
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,050
OK, as with all systems we're
going to think about, we have

603
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,430
to specify initial conditions.

604
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,240
The simplest kind of initial
conditions we could think

605
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,280
about would be rest.

606
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,070
If I thought about this system
at rest, then the initial

607
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,770
outputs of the R's would be 0.

608
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:40,650

609
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,560
That's at rest.

610
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,880
For times less than 0,
the input would be 0.

611
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:56,530
0 times 1.6 plus 0 times -0.63
plus 0 would give me 0.

612
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,240
Now, the clock ticks.

613
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,840
When the clock ticks,
it becomes times 0.

614
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,495
At times 0, the input is 1.

615
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,820

616
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,770
This 0 just propagated down to
here, but this was 0, so

617
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,325
nothing interesting happens
at the R's.

618
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:17,420

619
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,560
But now my output is 1.

620
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,790

621
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,100
Now, the clock ticks.

622
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,350
What happens?

623
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,390

624
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,315
When the clock ticks, this
1 propagates down here.

625
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:38,120

626
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,300
This 0 propagates down
here, but that was 0.

627
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,360

628
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,650
This 1 goes to 0 because the
input's only 1 at times 0.

629
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,900
So what's the output?

630
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,540

631
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,490
1.6.

632
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,660
Now, the clock ticks.

633
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,910
What happens?

634
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,170

635
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,690
Well, this 1 comes down here.

636
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,440
This 1.6 comes down here.

637
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,170

638
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,240
This 0 becomes another 0 because
the input has an

639
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,010
infinite stream of 0's after
the initial time.

640
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,260
So what's the output?

641
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,880

642
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,650
Well, it's 1.6 times 1.6 plus
1 times -0.63, so the answer

643
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,900
is number (3).

644
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,700

645
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,020
Yeah?

646
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,270
OK.

647
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,350

648
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,750
I forgot to write it
up there, so the

649
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,720
answer's in red down here.

650
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,260
1.6 squared minus 0.63.

651
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,940
OK?

652
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,850
The point is that it's slightly
more complicated to

653
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:00,610
think about than the case with a
single pole, and in fact, if

654
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,910
you use that logic to simply
step through all the

655
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,740
responses, you get a response
that doesn't look geometric.

656
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,080

657
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,060
The geometric sequences that we
looked at previously either

658
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,240
monotonically increased,
monotonically decreased

659
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,640
towards 0, or give one of
those two things and

660
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,410
alternated.

661
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,030
This does none of
those behaviors.

662
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,430
So the point is Freeman's
an idiot.

663
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,010
He spent all that time telling
us what one pole does, and now

664
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,100
two poles does something
completely different.

665
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,900
Right?

666
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,750
So the response is
not geometric.

667
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,110
The response grows
and then decays.

668
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,350
It never changes sign.

669
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,430
It does something completely
different from what we would

670
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,020
have expected from a
single pole system.

671
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,750
As you might expect from the
Theory of Lectures, that's not

672
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,980
the end of the story.

673
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:57,610
So the idea is to now capitalize
on this notion that

674
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,720
we can think about operators
as algebra.

675
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,950
If our expressions behaved like
I told you they did last

676
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:12,280
lecture, if they behaved as
entities upon which--

677
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,300
if they are isomorphic with
polynomials, as I said, then

678
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,760
there's a very cute thing we
can do with this system to

679
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,800
make it a lot simpler.

680
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,070
The thing we can do is factor.

681
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,510
If we think about the operator
expression to characterize

682
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,690
this system, the thing that's
different is that

683
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:37,850
there's an R squared.

684
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,990
But if R operators work just
like polynomials--

685
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,690
you can factor polynomials.

686
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,410
That's the factor theorem
from algebra.

687
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,120
And if I factor it, I get two
things that look like

688
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,770
first-order systems.

689
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,020
Well, that's good.

690
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,260

691
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:01,080
The factored form means that
I can think about this more

692
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,590
complicated system
as the cascade of

693
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,140
two first-order systems.

694
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,860
Well, that's pretty good.

695
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,910
In fact, it doesn't even matter
what order I put them

696
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,210
in because, as we've seen
previously, if the system

697
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,350
started at initial rest, then
you can swap things because

698
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,390
they obey all the principles of
polynomials, which include

699
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,640
commutation.

700
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,830

701
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,520
So what we've done, then,
is transform this more

702
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,280
complicated system into the
cascade of two simple systems,

703
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,530
and that's very good.

704
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,270

705
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:44,880
Even better, we can think about
the complicated system

706
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,940
as the sum of simpler parts, and
that uses more intuition

707
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,970
from polynomials.

708
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,750
If we have one over a
second-order polynomial, we

709
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,680
can write it in a factored form
here, but we can expand

710
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,870
it in what we call partial
fractions.

711
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:09,110
We can expand this thing in
this sum, and if you think

712
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,140
about putting this over a common
denominator and working

713
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,100
out the relationship, this
difference, 4.5 over 1 minus

714
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:22,280
0.9R minus 3.5 over
1 minus 0.7R.

715
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,020
That's precisely the same using
the normal rules for

716
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,110
polynomials.

717
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,650
That's precisely the same
as that expression.

718
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,400
But the difference, from the
point of view of thinking

719
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,550
about systems, is enormous.

720
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,310
We know the answer
to that one.

721
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,670
That's the sum of the responses
to two first-order

722
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:45,350
systems, so we can write that
symbolically this way.

723
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,830
We can think about having
a sum system that

724
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:51,190
generates this term.

725
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:55,110
This term is a simple system of
the type of that we looked

726
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:01,670
at previously that, then,
gets multiplied by 4.5.

727
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,540
I'm just factoring again.

728
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,690
I'm saying I've got something
over something, which means

729
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,950
that I can put something in each
of two different parts of

730
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,220
two things that I multiply
together.

731
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,230
And I can think about this as
having been generated by this

732
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,040
system, and you just
add them together.

733
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,430

734
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,790
The amazing thing is that that
says that, despite the fact

735
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,630
that the response looked
complicated, it was in fact

736
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,720
the sum of two geometrics.

737
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,850
So it wasn't very different
from the answer

738
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,550
for a single pole.

739
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,050
What I've just done
is amazing.

740
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,210
I've just taken something that,
had you studied the

741
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,410
difference equations and had
you studied the block

742
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,880
diagrams, it would have been
very hard for you to conclude

743
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,200
that something this complicated
has a response

744
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,930
that can be written as the
sum of two geometrics.

745
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,470
By thinking about the system
as a polynomial in R, it's

746
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,650
completely trivial.

747
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,290
It's a simple application of the
rules for polynomials that

748
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,950
you all know.

749
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,190
So what we've shown, then, is
that this complicated system

750
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,305
has a way of thinking
about as just two

751
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:18,190
of the simpler systems.

752
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,860
The complicated response that
grew and decayed, that's just

753
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:28,750
the difference, really,
4.5 minus 3.5.

754
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,560
It's the weighted difference of
a part that goes 0.7 to the

755
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,963
n, then a different part
that goes 0.9 to the n.

756
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:42,640

757
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,250
So far, we've got to results,
the n equals 1 case, the

758
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,620
first-order polynomial in our
case, the one pole case,

759
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,550
that's trivial.

760
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,490
It's just a geometric
sequence.

761
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,010
The response is just a
geometric sequence.

762
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,160
If it happens to be
second-order, this is

763
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,240
second-order because when you
write the operator expression,

764
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,260
the polynomial in the bottom is
second-order, second-order

765
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,740
polynomial in R.

766
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,270
This second-order system
has a response that

767
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:15,300
looks like two pieces.

768
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,750
Each piece looks like a
piece that was from

769
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,410
a first-order system.

770
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,675
And in fact, that idea
generalizes.

771
00:45:21,675 --> 00:45:25,470

772
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,790
If we have a system that can
be represented by linear

773
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,500
difference equation with
constant coefficients that

774
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,410
will always be true if the
system was constructed out of

775
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:43,270
the parts that we talked about,
adders, gains, delays.

776
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,060
If the system is constructed
out of adders, gains, and

777
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,290
delays, then it will be possible
to express the system

778
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,830
in terms of one difference
equation.

779
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,850
General form is showed here.

780
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,200
Y then can be constructed out
of parts that are delayed

781
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,210
versions of Y and delayed
versions of X. If you do that,

782
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:08,120
then you can always write the
operator that expresses the

783
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,630
ratio between the output and the
input as the ratio of two

784
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,000
polynomials.

785
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,880
That will always be true.

786
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,590
So this, now, is the
generalization step.

787
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,310
We did the n equals 1 case, we
did the n equals 2 case, and

788
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,730
now we're generalizing.

789
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:28,220
We will always get, for any
system that can be represented

790
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,080
by a linear difference equation
with constant

791
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,170
coefficients, we can always
represent the system

792
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,750
functional in this form.

793
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,060
Then just like we did in the
second-order case, we can use

794
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,420
the factor theorem to break
this polynomial in the

795
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,940
denominator into factors.

796
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,945
That comes from the factor
theorem in algebra.

797
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:54,640

798
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,480
Then we can re-express that in
terms of partial fractions.

799
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,820
And what I've just showed is
that, in the general case,

800
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,910
regardless of how many delays
are in the system, if the

801
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,430
system only has adders, gains,
and delays, I can always

802
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,020
express the answer as
a sum of geometrics.

803
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,710
That's interesting.

804
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,130
That means that if I knew the
bases for all of those

805
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:24,100
geometric sequences, I know
something about the response.

806
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,050
The bases are things
we call poles.

807
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:31,120
If you knew all the poles,
you'd know something very

808
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,370
powerful about the system.

809
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:36,330

810
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,590
So every one of the factors
corresponds to a pole, and by

811
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,770
partial fractions, you'll get
one response for each pole.

812
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,411
The response for each pole
goes like pole to the n.

813
00:47:48,411 --> 00:47:49,750
You know the basic shape.

814
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,470
You don't know the constants,
but you know the basic shape

815
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:58,880
of the response just by
knowing the poles.

816
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,110
We can go one more step,
which makes the

817
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,790
computation somewhat simpler.

818
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,600
I used the factor theorem.

819
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,160
Here, I'm using the fundamental
theorem of

820
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,960
algebra, which says that if I
have a polynomial of order n,

821
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,740
I have n roots.

822
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,530
The poles are related to the
roots of the R polynomial.

823
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,510

824
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:28,020
The relationship is take
the functional,

825
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,250
substitute for R --

826
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:38,500
1 over Z. Re-express the
functional as a ratio of

827
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,240
polynomials in Z. The poles
are the roots of the

828
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,490
denominator.

829
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,780

830
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,350
So recapping, I started with
a first-order system.

831
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,440
I showed you how to get
a second-order system.

832
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,760
I showed that, in general, you
can use the factor theorem to

833
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,730
break down the response of a
higher-order system into a sum

834
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,880
of responses of first-order
systems.

835
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,720
Now, I've shown that you can use
the fundamental theorem of

836
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,590
algebra to find the poles
directly, and then by knowing

837
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,030
the poles, you know each of
the behaviors, monotonic

838
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,280
divergence, monotonic
convergence,

839
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,870
or alternating signs.

840
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,770
And so here is this same example
that I started with,

841
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,260
worked out by thinking about
what are the poles.

842
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:29,280
The poles are 0.7 and 0.9,
which we see by a simple

843
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,300
application of the fundamental
theorem of algebra.

844
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:38,210
OK, we got a long way by just
thinking about operators as

845
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,080
polynomials.

846
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,880
We haven't done anything
that you haven't

847
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,300
done in high school.

848
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,090
Polynomials are very familiar
and we've made an isomorphism

849
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,100
between systems and
polynomials.

850
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,210

851
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,920
OK, make sure you're
all with me.

852
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,880
Here's a higher order system.

853
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,140
How many of these statements
are true --

854
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,030
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?

855
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,740

856
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,060
Talk to your neighbor,
get an answer.

857
00:50:06,060 --> 00:52:42,920

858
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,650
So how many are true --

859
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,660
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?

860
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,180

861
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,290
Oh, come on.

862
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,900
Blame it on your neighbor.

863
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,595
You weren't talking, but I
didn't hear you not talking.

864
00:52:53,595 --> 00:52:56,490

865
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,385
How many are true --

866
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:59,080
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5?

867
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,511
Raise your hands.

868
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,420
AUDIENCE: They can't
all be true.

869
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,555
PROFESSOR: They can't
all be true.

870
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,270
Are they mutually
contradictory?

871
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,180
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

872
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,090
5 --

873
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,390
PROFESSOR: N1 of the above,
that sounds like--

874
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,650
OK, so you've eliminated 1.

875
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,310

876
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,786
Which one's true?

877
00:53:14,786 --> 00:53:18,132
How many statements are true?

878
00:53:18,132 --> 00:53:21,700
Looks like about 75%.

879
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,130
Correct?

880
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,261
What should I do?

881
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:26,390
How do I figure it out?

882
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,120
What's my first step?

883
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,878
What do I do?

884
00:53:27,878 --> 00:53:30,270
AUDIENCE: Operators.

885
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,080
PROFESSOR: Operators,
absolutely.

886
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,690
So turn it into operators.

887
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,060
So take the difference
equation,

888
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,110
turn it into operators.

889
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:44,500
The important thing to see is
that there are three Y terms.

890
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,950
Take them all to the same side,
and I get an operator

891
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,420
expression like that.

892
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,200
The ones that depend on X, there
are two of them, that's

893
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,410
represented here.

894
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,210
The thing this is critical for
determining poles is figuring

895
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:02,770
out the denominator.

896
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,225
The poles are going to
come from this one.

897
00:54:04,225 --> 00:54:06,920

898
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:16,080
After I get the ratio of two
polynomials in R, I substitute

899
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:21,790
1 over Z for each R. So for this
R, I get 1 over Z. For

900
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:25,350
this R squared, I get
1 over Z squared.

901
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,020
Then I want to turn it back into
a ratio of polynomials in

902
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:34,710
Z, so I have to multiply top
and bottom by Z squared.

903
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:45,700
And when I do that, I get this
ratio of polynomials in Z.

904
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:51,400
The poles are the roots of the
denominator polynomial in Z.

905
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:57,820
The poles are minus
1/2 and plus 1/4.

906
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,095
So the unit sample response
converges to 0.

907
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:04,680

908
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,690
What would be the condition
that that represents?

909
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,050

910
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,990
AUDIENCE: Take the polynomial
on the bottom.

911
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:15,780
PROFESSOR: Something about the
polynomial on the bottom.

912
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,030
Would all second-order systems
have that property that the

913
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,774
unit sample response would
converge to 0?

914
00:55:20,774 --> 00:55:22,024
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

915
00:55:22,024 --> 00:55:24,150

916
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,520
PROFESSOR: Louder?

917
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,820
AUDIENCE: Absolute value
of the poles?

918
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,526
PROFESSOR: Absolute value
of the poles has to be?

919
00:55:31,526 --> 00:55:32,990
AUDIENCE: Less than 1.

920
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,110
PROFESSOR: Less than 1.

921
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,380
If the magnitude of the poles
is less than 1, then the

922
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,370
response magnitude will
decay with time.

923
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:44,080
So that's true here, and it
would be true so long as none

924
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,930
of the poles have a magnitude
exceeding 1.

925
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,030
There are poles at
1/2 and 1/4.

926
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,050
No, that's not right.

927
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,640
It's -1/2 or 1/4.

928
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,830
There's a pole at 1/2.

929
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,640
No, that's not right.

930
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,450
There's a pole at -1/2.

931
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,260
There are two poles.

932
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,870
Yes, that's true.

933
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:01,520
None of the above.

934
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,340
No, that's not true.

935
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,210
So the answer was (2).

936
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,410
Everybody's comfortable?

937
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:08,970
We've done something
very astonishing.

938
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:13,410
We took an arbitrary system, and
we've figured out a rule

939
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:15,820
that let's us break
it into the sum

940
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,820
of geometric sequences.

941
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,750
We can always write the response
to a unit sample

942
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:25,250
signal, we can always write, as
a weighted sum of geometric

943
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:30,440
sequences, and the number of
geometric sequences in the sum

944
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,030
is the number of poles, which
is the order of the operator

945
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,920
that operates on Y.
OK, so we've done

946
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,720
something very powerful.

947
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,490
There's one more thing that we
have to think about, and then

948
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:48,340
we have a complete picture
of what's going on.

949
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,800
Think about when you learned
polynomials.

950
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,450

951
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:57,180
One of the big shocks was that
roots can be complex.

952
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,940
What would that mean?

953
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:05,660
What would it mean if we had
a system whose poles were

954
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,510
complex valued?

955
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,480
So first off, does such
a system exist?

956
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,050
Well, here's one.

957
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:12,720
I just pulled that
out of the air.

958
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,230
If I think about the functional,
1 over (1 minus R

959
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,490
plus R squared) --

960
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:23,480
if I convert that into our ratio
of polynomials in Z and

961
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,640
then find the roots, I
find that the roots

962
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,070
have a complex part.

963
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,195
The roots are 1/2 plus or
minus root 3 over 2j.

964
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:33,020

965
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,970
There's an imaginary part.

966
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,330
So the question is what
would that mean?

967
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,370
Or is perhaps that system
just meaningless?

968
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,970

969
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:51,530
Well, complex numbers work in
algebra, and complex numbers

970
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,000
work here, too.

971
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,280
So the fact that a pole has a
complex value in the context

972
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,770
of signals and systems simply
means that the pole is

973
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:10,520
complex, that the base of the
geometric sequence, that base

974
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,200
is complex.

975
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,500
So that means that we can still
rewrite the denominator,

976
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,960
which was 1 minus R plus R
squared, we can rewrite that

977
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,830
denominator in terms of a
product of two first-order R

978
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,460
polynomials.

979
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,580
The coefficients are now
complex, but it still works.

980
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:34,950
The algebra still works right.

981
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,560
That has to work because that's
just polynomials.

982
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,020
That's the way polynomials
behave.

983
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,610
Now, we can still factor it.

984
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:41,930
We can still use the
factor theorem.

985
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,760
In fact, we can still use the
fundamental theorem of algebra

986
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,820
to find the poles
by the Z trick.

987
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,950
That's fine.

988
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,890
We can still use partial
fractions.

989
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:54,050
All of these numbers
are complex, but

990
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:56,250
the math still works.

991
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:00,120
The funny thing is that
it implies that

992
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,620
the fundamental modes--

993
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,440
by fundamental mode, I mean the
simple geometric for the

994
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,380
case of a first-order system,
more complex behaviors for

995
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,630
higher order systems.

996
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:15,130
The mode is the time response
associated with a pole.

997
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:20,006
So the modes are, in this case,
complexes sequences.

998
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:24,140

999
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:32,040
So in general, the modes
look like P0 to the n.

1000
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,260
Here, my modes are simply
have a complex value.

1001
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,740
So what did I say they were?

1002
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:40,210
The poles were 1/2
plus or minus--

1003
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:47,320

1004
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,940
so my modes simply look that.

1005
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,010
Same thing.

1006
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:55,625
The strange thing that happened
was that those modes,

1007
00:59:55,625 --> 01:00:00,860
those geometric sequences, are
now have complex values.

1008
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,680
The first one up here, if I just
look at the denominator,

1009
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,680
these coefficients mean that
it's proportionate to the mode

1010
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,190
associated with this, which is
that, which has a real part,

1011
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,490
which is the blue part, and
the imaginary part,

1012
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,740
which is a red part.

1013
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,260

1014
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,330
There were two poles,
plus and minus.

1015
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:25,420
The other pole just flips
the imaginary part.

1016
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,480

1017
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,740
So if I have imaginary poles,
all I get is complex modes,

1018
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,660
complex geometric sequences.

1019
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:42,620

1020
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,840
An easier way of thinking about
that is thinking about--

1021
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:51,020
so when we had a simple, real
pole, we just had P0 to the n.

1022
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,900
That's easy to visualize because
we just think about

1023
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,960
each time you go from 0 to 1 to
2 to 3, it goes from 1 to

1024
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,220
P0 to P0 squared to P0 cubed.

1025
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,990
Here, when you're multiplying
complex numbers, it's easier

1026
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:06,800
to imagine that on the
complex plane.

1027
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,020
Think about the location of the
point 1, think about the

1028
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,270
location of the point P0, think
about the location of

1029
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,180
the point P0 squared, and in
this particular case, where

1030
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,400
the pole was 1/2 plus or minus
the square root of 3 over 2

1031
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,700
times j, this would
be pole to the 0.

1032
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,510
This is pole to the 1.

1033
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:33,330
This is pole squared,
pole cubed.

1034
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,870
As you can see when you have a
complex number, the trajectory

1035
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,280
in complex space can
be complicated.

1036
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,560
In this case, it's circular.

1037
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,680
The circular trajectory in the
complex plane corresponds to

1038
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,070
the sinusoidal behavior
in time.

1039
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,850
So there's a correlation between
the way you think

1040
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:55,300
about the modes evolving on the
complex plane and the way

1041
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,720
you think about the
real and imaginary

1042
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,210
parts evolving in time.

1043
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:02,560

1044
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,950
It seems a little
weird that the

1045
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:08,570
response should be complex.

1046
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:12,040
We're studying this kind of
system theory primarily

1047
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,290
because we're trying to gain
insight into real systems.

1048
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:16,690
We want to know how things
like robots work.

1049
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:17,900
How does the WallFinder work?

1050
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,190
What would it mean if the
WallFinder went to position

1051
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:26,040
one plus the square
root of 3 over 2j?

1052
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,100
That doesn't make sense.

1053
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,930
So there's a little bit of a
strange thing going on here.

1054
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:35,550
How is it that we need complex
numbers to model real things?

1055
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,690
That doesn't seem
to sound right.

1056
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:42,710
But the answer is that, if the
difference equation had real

1057
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:48,270
coefficients, as they will
for a real system--

1058
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:50,770
if you think about a real
system, like a bank account,

1059
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:53,850
the coefficients in the
difference equation are real

1060
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,940
numbers, not complex numbers.

1061
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,320
If you think about the
WallFinder system, the

1062
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:03,140
coefficients in the WallFinder
system, the coefficients of

1063
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,940
the difference equations--

1064
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,720
the coefficients of the
different equations describe

1065
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,080
the WallFinder behavior
were all real numbers.

1066
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:16,050

1067
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,620
Here, I'm thinking about the
denominator polynomial.

1068
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:23,230
If we try to find the roots of a
polynomial, and if we find a

1069
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:28,430
complex root, if the
coefficients were all real, it

1070
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:33,150
follows that the complex
conjugate of the original root

1071
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,390
is also a root.

1072
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,210
That's pretty simple, if you
think about what it means to

1073
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,460
be a polynomial.

1074
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,020
If you think about a polynomial
is whatever--

1075
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:51,380
so I've got 1 plus Z plus Z
squared plus blah, blah, blah.

1076
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:54,850

1077
01:03:54,850 --> 01:04:04,230
2, 3 minus 16, if all of those
coefficients real, then the

1078
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,480
only way the--

1079
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:10,530

1080
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:16,880
If P were a root of this
polynomial, then P* would have

1081
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,340
to be a root, too, because if
you complex conjugate each of

1082
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,790
the Z's, it's the same thing
as complex conjugating the

1083
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:30,970
whole thing because the
coefficients are real valued.

1084
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:36,780
So the idea then is that if I
happen to get a complex root

1085
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:39,530
for my system that can be
described by real value

1086
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:43,380
coefficients, it must also
be true that it's complex

1087
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,790
conjugate is a root.

1088
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:51,720
If that happens, the two roots
co-conspire so that the modes

1089
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,240
have canceling imaginary
parts.

1090
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:54,920
You can prove that.

1091
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,000
I'm not worried about you being
able to prove that.

1092
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,800
I just want you to understand
that if you have two roots

1093
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:06,080
that are complex conjugates,
they can conspire to have

1094
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,980
their imaginary parts
cancel, and that's

1095
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,120
exactly what happens.

1096
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:15,190
Here, in this example, the
example that I started with,

1097
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,860
where the system was 1 over (1
minus R plus R squared), the

1098
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,510
unit sample responses
showed here.

1099
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,170

1100
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:29,350
You can write as the sum of
sinusoidal and cosinusoidal

1101
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:35,780
signals, and the sum that falls
out has the property

1102
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:39,490
that the imaginary
parts cancel.

1103
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,560
It's still useful to look at the
imaginary parts the same

1104
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,560
as it is when you're trying
to solve polynomials.

1105
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,230
It's useful because the
period of all of these

1106
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,490
signals is the same.

1107
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:53,500

1108
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,900
If I think about the period of
the individual modes, if I

1109
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,380
think about the period of P0
to the n, 1/2 plus or minus

1110
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:04,740
root 3 over 2j to the n, the
period of that signal --

1111
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,810
I can see in the complex plane,
this is the n equals 0,

1112
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:13,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12 --

1113
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,310
the period is 6.

1114
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:20,940
If I were to take the minus 1,
I would go around the circle

1115
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:22,220
the other way.

1116
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:26,850
This would be zero term 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, et cetera.

1117
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:33,620
Both of the modes, the geometric
sequence associated

1118
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:37,670
with the two complex conjugate
poles, both of those modes had

1119
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:40,590
the same period, they're
both 6, as does the

1120
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,670
response to the real part.

1121
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:50,690
So you can deduce the period of
the real signal by looking

1122
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,055
at the periods of the
two complex signals.

1123
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:57,440

1124
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,980
So think about this system.

1125
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:04,420
Here, I've got a system whose
responses showed here.

1126
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,740
I'm going to tell you that the
response was generated by a

1127
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,420
second-order system, that
is to say a system whose

1128
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:13,720
polynomial was second-order,
whose polynomial in R was

1129
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,440
second-order.

1130
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,375
Which of these statements
is true?

1131
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:21,830

1132
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:25,730
I want to think about the pole
as being a complex number.

1133
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:29,640
Here, I'm showing you the
complex number in polar form.

1134
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,370
It's got a magnitude and an
angle, and I'd like you to

1135
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:38,210
figure how what must the
magnitude have been, and what

1136
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:39,997
must the angle have been.

1137
01:07:39,997 --> 01:08:40,140

1138
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,290
So what's the utility?

1139
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:46,553
Why did I tell you the pole in
terms of it's magnitude and

1140
01:08:46,553 --> 01:08:51,310
angle rather than telling it to
you in it's Cartesian form

1141
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:54,100
as a real and imaginary part?

1142
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,266
What's good about thinking about
magnitude and angle?

1143
01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:02,577

1144
01:09:02,577 --> 01:09:06,140
Or if I break the pole into
magnitude and angle, and if I

1145
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,390
think about the mode--

1146
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:10,370

1147
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:14,870
the modes are always of
the form P0 to the n.

1148
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:20,010
If I think about modes as having
a magnitude and an

1149
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:25,680
angle, when I raise it
to the n, something

1150
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,090
very special happens.

1151
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:30,340
What happens?

1152
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,830

1153
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:35,420
You can separate it.

1154
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:39,250
What is R e to the j omega
raised to the n?

1155
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:49,260
That's the same as R to the
n, e to the j n omega.

1156
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:55,040
It's the product of a real
thing times a very simple

1157
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,950
complex thing.

1158
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,660
What's simple about
the complex thing?

1159
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,330

1160
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:05,050
The magnitude is everywhere
1 e to the j, the

1161
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:08,730
magnitude of that term.

1162
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,180
So all of the magnitude
is here, none of the

1163
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,210
magnitude is here.

1164
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,920
All of the angle is here, none
of the angle is here.

1165
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,270
I've separated the magnitude
and the angle.

1166
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:23,300
So it's very insightful to think
about poles in terms of

1167
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:28,910
magnitude and angle because
it decouples the

1168
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:31,080
parts of the mode.

1169
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,050
So I can think, then, of this
complicated signal that I gave

1170
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:39,350
you as being the product of a
magnitude part and a pure

1171
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:41,180
angle part.

1172
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:48,180
From the magnitude part, I can
infer something about R. R is

1173
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:54,480
the ratio of the nth 1 to the
n minus 1-th one, so R is a

1174
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,120
lot bigger than 1/2.

1175
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:04,390
In fact, R in this
case is 0.97.

1176
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,930
And this is pure angle.

1177
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:11,600
This lets me infer something
about the oscillations.

1178
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,530
In fact, I can say something
about the period.

1179
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,130
The period is, here's a peak,
here's a peak, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

1180
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,380
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

1181
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:21,460

1182
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,270
The period's 12.

1183
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,410
If the period is 12,
what is omega?

1184
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:42,330

1185
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:47,350
Omega is a number, such that
by the time I got up to 12

1186
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:51,860
times it, I got up to 2 pi.

1187
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:55,420

1188
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,070
What's omega?

1189
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,290
AUDIENCE: Pi over 6.

1190
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,540
PROFESSOR: 2 pi over 12.

1191
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,180

1192
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,430
So it's about 1/2.

1193
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:05,510

1194
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:10,710
So that's a way that I can infer
the form of the answer.

1195
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:15,660
I ask you what pole corresponds
to this behavior.

1196
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,570
Well, the decay that comes from
the real part, that comes

1197
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:21,580
from R to the n.

1198
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:26,100
The oscillation, that comes from
the imaginary part, and I

1199
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,400
can figure that out by thinking
about the period and

1200
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,650
thinking about that
relationship.

1201
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:40,260

1202
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,720
So the answer, then, is this
one, R is between 1/2 and 1,

1203
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,040
and omega is about 1/2.

1204
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,150
OK, one last-- whoops,
wrong button.

1205
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:51,400
One last example.

1206
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,330

1207
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:57,110
So what we've seen is a very
powerful way of decomposing

1208
01:12:57,110 --> 01:13:01,650
systems, so that we can always
think about them in terms of

1209
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:06,420
poles and complex geometrics,
which we will call modes,

1210
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,070
poles and modes.

1211
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:12,530
And that behavior works for
any system in an enormous

1212
01:13:12,530 --> 01:13:16,080
class of systems, so I want to
think about one last one,

1213
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,620
which is Fibonacci sequence.

1214
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,080
You all know the Fibonacci
sequence.

1215
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,260
You've all programmed it.

1216
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,640
We started with that when we
were doing Python, and we made

1217
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,800
some illustrations about the
recursion and all that sort of

1218
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,120
thing by thinking about it.

1219
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,190
Now, I'm going to
use signals and

1220
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:30,270
systems do the same problem.

1221
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:33,370
So Fibonacci was interested
in population growth.

1222
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:36,720
How many pairs of rabbits can be
produced from a single pair

1223
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,140
in a year if it is suppose that
every month each pair

1224
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:44,400
begets a new pair, from which
the second month it becomes

1225
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,040
productive?

1226
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,500
OK, it's not quite the same
English I would have used.

1227
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:54,470
From this statement, you can
infer a difference equation.

1228
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,910
I've written it in terms of
X. What do you think X is?

1229
01:13:56,910 --> 01:14:00,700

1230
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:05,740
X is the input signal, and here,
I'm thinking about X as

1231
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,960
something that's specifies
the initial condition.

1232
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,170
This is the thing I alluded
to earlier.

1233
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:16,780
One trick that we use to make it
easy to think about initial

1234
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:21,660
conditions is that we embed
them in the input.

1235
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,540
So in this particular case, I'll
think about the initial

1236
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:28,060
condition arising from
a delta function.

1237
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:33,630
If I think about X as a delta,
then the sequence of results

1238
01:14:33,630 --> 01:14:37,590
Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3 from this
difference equation, is the

1239
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,860
conventional Fibonacci
sequence.

1240
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:44,590
It would correspond to what if
you had a baby rabbit, one

1241
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:48,330
baby rabbit, that's the
one, in generation

1242
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:52,030
0, that's the delta.

1243
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,960
So the input is a way that
I can specify initial

1244
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,530
conditions, and that's a very
powerful way of thinking about

1245
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,100
initial conditions.

1246
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,350
So here's the problem.

1247
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:04,370
I've got one set of baby
rabbits at times 0.

1248
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,370
They grow up.

1249
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:13,750
They have baby rabbits, which
grow up at the same time the

1250
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:19,980
parents had more baby rabbits,
at which point more babies

1251
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:22,110
grow into bigger rabbits.

1252
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:26,460
And big rabbits have more
babies, et cetera, et cetera,

1253
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,640
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.

1254
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:33,520

1255
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,850
So you all know that.

1256
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,710
You all know about Fibonacci
sequence.

1257
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:38,390
It blows up very quickly.

1258
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,945
What are the poles of the
Fibonacci sequence?

1259
01:15:40,945 --> 01:15:49,920

1260
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,970
The difference equation looks
just like the difference

1261
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,560
equations we've looked
at throughout

1262
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,470
this hour and a half.

1263
01:15:56,470 --> 01:16:00,320
We can do it just like we did
all the other problems.

1264
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,260
We write the difference equation
in terms of R. We

1265
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:08,340
rewrite the system functional
in terms of a ratio of two

1266
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:13,180
polynomials in R. We substitute
R goes to 1 over Z,

1267
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:18,340
deduce a ratio of polynomials in
Z, factor the denominator,

1268
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,810
find the roots of the
denominator, and find that

1269
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:24,050
there are two poles.

1270
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:27,830
The poles for the Fibonacci
sequence are plus or minus the

1271
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,400
root of 5 over 2.

1272
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,290
That's curious.

1273
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:33,330
There's no recursion there.

1274
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,310
It's a different way of
thinking about things.

1275
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:38,920
There are two poles.

1276
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:41,300
The first pole, the
plus one --

1277
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:46,540
1 plus the root of 5 over 1,
corresponds to a pole whose

1278
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,180
magnitude is bigger than 1.

1279
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,710
It explodes.

1280
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,970
There it is.

1281
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:55,170
The second one is a
negative number.

1282
01:16:55,170 --> 01:17:00,770
So the first one is the
golden ratio, 1.618...

1283
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:03,070
The second one is the negative
reciprocal of the golden

1284
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:08,590
ratio, which is -0.618...

1285
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:14,710
And those two numbers,
amazingly, conspire so that

1286
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:21,240
their sum, horrendous as they
are, is an integer.

1287
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,330
And in fact, that's the integer
that we computed here.

1288
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:28,210
So we've used Fibonacci before
to think about the way you

1289
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:33,190
structure programs, iteration,
recursion, that sort of thing.

1290
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,030
Here, by thinking about signals
and systems, we can

1291
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:40,370
think about exactly the
same problem as poles.

1292
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:42,190
There's no complexity
in this problem.

1293
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,780
It doesn't take N or N
squared or N log N

1294
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,190
or anything to compute.

1295
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:48,470
It's closed form.

1296
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:53,100
The answer is (pole one) to the
N plus (pole two) to the

1297
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,400
N. That's it.

1298
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,500
That's the answer.

1299
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,810
So what we've done is we found
a whole new way of thinking

1300
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:02,160
about the Fibonacci sequence
in terms of poles, and more

1301
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,380
than that, we found that that
way of thinking about poles

1302
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:10,150
works for any difference
equation of this type.

1303
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:14,160
And we found that poles, this
way of thinking about systems

1304
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,190
in terms of polynomials, is a
powerful abstraction that's

1305
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,110
exactly the same kind
of PCAP abstraction

1306
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,360
that we used for Python.

1307
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:30,783
